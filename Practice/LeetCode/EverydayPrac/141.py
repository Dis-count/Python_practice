# 879. Profitable Schemes
# There is a group of n members, and a list of various crimes they could commit. The ith crime generates a profit[i] and requires group[i] members to participate in it. If a member participates in one crime, that member can't participate in another crime.
#
# Let's call a profitable scheme any subset of these crimes that generates at least minProfit profit, and the total number of members participating in that subset of crimes is at most n.
#
# Return the number of schemes that can be chosen. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: n = 5, minProfit = 3, group = [2,2], profit = [2,3]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: To make a profit of at least 3, the group could either commit crimes 0 and 1, or just crime 1.
# In total, there are 2 schemes.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: n = 10, minProfit = 5, group = [2,3,5], profit = [6,7,8]
# Output: 7
# Explanation: To make a profit of at least 5, the group could commit any crimes, as long as they commit one.
# There are 7 possible schemes: (0), (1), (2), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), and (0,1,2).

# 动态规划
# 本题解法的三个维度分别为：当前可选择的工作，已选择的小组员工人数，以及目前状态的工作获利下限。
# 定义一个三维数组 dp 作为动态规划的状态，其中 dp[i][j][k] 表示在前 i 个工作中选择了 j 个员工，并且满足工作利润至少为 k 的情况下的盈利计划的总数目。
