Villa E.<br>Clinical and Molecular Hepatology (2017) 23:1 (13-21). Date of Publication: <br>1 Mar 2017<br><br>The liver plays a crucial role in coagulation cascade. Global hemostatic <br>process is profoundly influenced by the presence of liver disease and its <br>complications. Patients with cirrhosis have impaired synthesis of most of <br>the factors involved in coagulation and fibrinolysis process due to a <br>reduced liver function and altered platelet count secondary to portal <br>hypertension. Altered routine tests and thrombocytopenia were considered in <br>the past as associated with increased risk of bleeding. These concepts <br>explain both the routine use of plasma and/or platelets transfusion in <br>patients with <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span>, especially before invasive procedures, and <br>why these patients were considered “auto-anticoagulated”. New recent <br>evidences show that patients with <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> have a more complex <br>hemostatic alteration. Despite the presence of altered levels of factors <br>involved in primary hemostasis, coagulation and fibrinolysis, patients with <br>stable cirrhosis have a rebalanced hemostatic, which however can easily be <br>altered by decompensation or infection, both in hemorrhagic or thrombotic <br>direction. Patients with cirrhosis have an increased risk of venous <br>thrombotic events (namely <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>) while bleeding seems to be <br>related to the grade of portal hypertension rather than to a hemostatic <br>imbalance. The use of anticoagulants both as treatment or prophylaxis is <br>safe, reduces the rate of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> and decompensation, and <br>improves survival. Standard laboratory coagulation tests are unable to <br>predict bleeding and are inadequate for the assessment of hemostatic status <br>in these patients, hence more comprehensive tests are required to guide the <br>management of thrombotic and bleeding complications.<br><br>RECORD 8<br>Effective Prevention for Portal Venous System Thrombosis after Splenectomy: <br>A Meta-Analysis<br>Zhang X. Wang Y. Yu M. Huang J. Deng D. Xue H.<br>Journal of Laparoendoscopic and Advanced Surgical Techniques (2017) 27:3 <br>(247-252). Date of Publication: 1 Mar 2017<br><br>Purpose: Portal venous system thrombosis (PVST) is a common and potentially <br>life-threatening complication of splenectomy for portal hypertension due to <br>cirrhosis. Methods: A meta-analysis was conducted to study the necessity of <br>pharmacologic prophylaxis of PVST after splenectomy and how to select the <br>feasible treatment method. Articles were searched through the PubMed, <br>EMBASE, Cochrane Library databases, and CNKI. Results: Overall, 404 articles <br>were initially identified, and 11 of them were eligible. Among these <br>selected articles, 7 articles were associated with the necessity of <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> for prevention of PVST, while 5 were about the drug <br>selection. We first demonstrated that the incidence of PVST after <br>splenectomy was significantly lower in patients who received the preventive <br>measures than in those who did not (odds ratio [OR]: 0.22, 95% confidence <br>interval [CI]: 0.13-0.39, P < .00001). Then, we compared the new-style <br>treatment with the conventional treatment and found that patients with new <br>therapy method had lower incidence of PVST than those who received <br>conventional treatment (OR: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.27-0.51, P < .00001). Also, some <br>studies (n = 4) reported that early and combination use of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>drugs can lead to better outcome for patients with splenectomy and <br>devascularization. Conclusion: Preventative use of anticoagulant drugs might <br>decrease the incidence of PVST after splenectomy in patients with portal <br>hypertension, new anticoagulant drugs such as low-molecular-weight heparin <br>should be used, and early or combination use of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> drugs might <br>lead to lower PVST incidence for patients.<br><br>RECORD 9<br>Clinical impact of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> prior to liver transplantation: A <br>retrospective cohort study<br>Karvellas C.J.

To identify the impact of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) and <br>associated medical and surgical factors on outcomes post liver transplant <br>(LT). Material and methods. Two analyses were performed. Analysis One: <br>cohort study of 505 consecutive patients who underwent LT (Alberta) between <br>01/2002-12/2012. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was identified in 61 (14%) patients. Analysis Two: <br>cohort study of 144 consecutive <span style="color: red">PVT</span> patients from two sites (Alberta and <br>London) during the same period. Cox multivariable survival analysis was used <br>to identify independent associations with post-LT mortality. Results. In <br>Analysis One (Alberta), <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was not associated with post-LT mortality (log <br>rank p = 0.99). On adjusted analysis, complete/occlusive <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was associated <br>with increased mortality (Hazard Ratio (HR) 8.4, p < 0.001). In Analysis Two <br>(Alberta and London), complete/occlusive <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was associated with increased <br>mortality only on unadjusted analysis (HR 3.7, p = 0.02). On adjusted <br>analysis, Hepatitis C (HR 2.1, p = 0.03) and post-LT portal vein <br>re-occlusion (HR 3.2, p = 0.01) were independently associated with increased <br>mortality. Conclusion: Well-selected LT patients who had <span style="color: red">PVT</span> prior to LT had <br>similar post-LT outcomes to non-<span style="color: red">PVT</span> LT recipients.

Yuan L. Jian W.<br>Hepatology International (2017) 11:1 Supplement 1 (S324-S325). Date of <br>Publication: 1 Feb 2017<br><br>Background: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is one of the common complications <br>of decompensated <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> (LC), now the most common method for <br>thrombosis is <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy, the clinical use of anticoagulant <br>treatment to <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> is very careful, even patients with <br>portal vein thrombos are may not use anticoagulant therapy because of the <br>risk of bleeding. But there are reports that anticoagulant therapy does not <br>increase the incidence the upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and clinical <br>tests show that patients giving anticoagulant therapy after endoscopic <br>variceal sequential therapy does not increase the risk of upper <br>gastrointestinal bleeding. Therefore, whether giving <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy <br>for <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> with <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> is still not unified. <br>Methods: Review 239 cases of cirrhosis patients diagnosed in our hospital <br>from 2012.1 to 2012.12, 33 cases of <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> combined with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>patients were thrombosis group. 10 patients giving anticoagulant therapy of <br>33 cases were <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy group, and the other 23 cases were <br>control group. In the 33 cases of cirrhosis patients with portal vein <br>thrombosis, the 10 patients with esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage were <br>hemorrhagic group, 23 patients without bleeding were not hemorrhage control <br>group. Recording patients age, gender, etiology, whether there was a history <br>of diabetes and splenectomy, spleen thickness and width of portal vein, the <br>degree of esophageal and gastric varices, with or without portal <br>hypertension and liver ulcer, ascites extent, Child-Pugh score, with or <br>without endoscopic variceal sequential therapy and taking propranolol, as <br>well as laboratory tests.

Result: 1. The degree of <br>esophageal and gastric varices was a risk factor, P<0.05; endoscopic <br>variceal sequential therapy was a protective factor, the bleeding rates <br>compared with sequential therapy and no treated people was 30 and 73.9% <br>respectively, a significant difference (P <0.05). 2. The bleeding rates <br>between anticoagulant therapy group and control group in the use of <br>anticoagulant drugs was 40 and 26.1% respectively, no significant difference <br>(P >0.05). Conclusion: The esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage of cirrhosis <br>patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was closely related to the degree of varicose vein. The <br>endoscopic variceal sequential therapy can significantly reduce the risk of <br>variceal bleeding of cirrhosis patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Anticoagulant therapy for <br>cirrhosis patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> may not increase esophagogastric variceal <br>hemorrhage incidence.

Elfeyfi A.E.<br>Hepatology International (2017) 11:1 Supplement 1 (S578). Date of <br>Publication: 1 Feb 2017<br><br>Background: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> is a rare hepatic vascular disease. It is <br>an important cause of noncirrhotic prehepatic portal hypertension. Over the <br>last few years, it has been increasingly diagnosed by the widespread use of <br>Doppler ultrasound. The aim of this study was to describe risk factors and <br>etiologies, clinical presentation, complications, and treatment of portal <br>vein thrombosis in a single center study. Methods: 120 patients were <br>identified from 1991 to 2016 (25 years). All data were obtained from the <br>patient records. Patients with cirrhosis were excluded. Result: The group <br>included 76 women and 44 men. The mean age was 36.5 years (06-82 years). <br>Common symptoms were hemorrhage in 58.3% of cases, abdominal pain in 55%, <br>signs of portal hypertension were present in more than 75% of cases. The <br>diagnosis was established by Doppler ultrasound that showed the portal <br>thrombosis and its extension or the portal cavernous transformation in some <br>cases. The endoscopy showed that 83% of patients had esophageal varices, <br>associated with gastric varices in 16% of cases and to portal hypertensive <br>gastropathy in 14% of cases. In our study, prothrombotic disorder was found <br>in 32.5% of cases, especially protein C and S deficiency, the association of <br>multiples deficiency was found in 22% of cases. Primary myeloproliferative <br>syndromes were reported in 7% of all the patients. Other causes were found, <br>like celiac disease by hyperhomocysteinemia, liver abscess, tuberculosis, <br>hepatocellular carcinoma, systemic lupus, choledocolithiasis, abdominal <br>trauma and pregnancy. Patients with varices were treated endoscopically with <br>band ligation and/or sclerotherapy and pharmacological treatment by <br>b-blockers with treatment of the cause if it was identified. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>therapy was proposed to 9 patients who had clinical manifestations of <br>thrombosis. The extension of the thrombosis wasn't seen after the stopping <br>of the anticoagulants and the patients who didn't receive any <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy didn't present any extension of thrombosis. 5 deaths <br>were enregistered in our study with 1 case of intestinal infarction died <br>after surgery. Conclusion: The <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> is a disorder with a <br>good prognosis which should be rapidly diagnosed and which requires <br>interdisciplinary collaboration in order to prevent or treat invariably <br>ensuing complications. The outcome of some patients on our study is good <br>even without <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy. It's indicated in acute portal vein <br>thrombosis.

Date of Publication: 2 Dec 2016<br><br>Background: Splanchnic venous thrombosis (SVT) encompasses thrombosis in the <br>mesenteric, splenic or portal veins (with or without hepatic veins <br>involvement). Little is known about appropriate therapeutic interventions <br>and long-term clinical outcome of SVT patients. Aim of this study was to <br>identify the correct management of SVT and encourage a multidisciplinary <br>approach by a team composed of hematologists, hepatologists, and <br>infectivologists. Methods:We analyzed clinical, laboratory, therapeutic and <br>outcome data of 127 patients with SVT that were recruited from 2000 to 2016. <br>In patients with no active bleeding, <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> treatment was started <br>as soon as possible, according to platelet count. We administered <br>intermediate or full therapeutic dose low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) <br>and early initiation of vitamin-K antagonist (VKA; INR range 2-3 or 1.8-2.5 <br>in patients with high bleeding risk) for a platelet count >50.000/μl, only <br>half or prophylactic dose of LMWH for a platelet count >30.000 and < <br>50.000/μl and no treatment for a platelet count <30.000/μl. Indefinite <br>duration treatment was used for patients with persistent or permanent risk <br>(i.e. cirrhosis, active solid cancer and hematological cancer). Moreover, an <br>appropriate prophylaxis with beta-blockers and endoscopic therapies were <br>applied in cirrhotic SVT. The quality of VKA treatment was assessed by the <br>time in therapeutic range (TTR). The number of vascular complications was <br>expressed as incidence rate, calculated by the number of events per 100 <br>patients-year of observation. The Kaplan-Meier method was performed to <br>estimate the time to reach vessel recanalization. Cox regression analysis <br>was used to identify independent predictors of vascular events or <br>recanalization. Results: Overall, 127 patients were included (median age 58 <br>years; 74% males). The median follow-up of all patients was 11 months <br>(1-212). <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> was the most common site of thrombosis <br>(50%), followed by multiple venous involvement (37%). <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> and <br>solid neoplasms were the common underlying disease (72% and 36% <br>respectively) while myeloproliferative neoplasms were identified in 8 <br>patients (6.2%). Eighty-nine patients (70%) had esophageal varices (grade >2 <br>in 55 patients) and 81 (64%) had thrombocytopenia (mean 72.000/ μl range <br>28.000/μl-148.000/μl). Ninety-nine patients (78%) were treated with <br>anticoagulant therapy: 36% with intermediate or full dose of LMWH, 40% with <br>half or prophylactic dose of LMWH and 24% with VKA (TTR 76%). During a <br>median duration therapy of 7 months, the incidence rate of thrombotic events <br>was 1.1 per 100 pt-y while the incidence rate of major bleeding was 1.6 per <br>100 pt-y. At univariate analysis, esophageal varices (p=0.030), renal <br>failure (p=0.001) and <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> (p=0.05) significantly increased the <br>risk of bleeding events. Moreover VKA exposure was associated with a <br>significantly lower risk of bleeding events compared to LMWH (p=0.042). <br>Fifty-six patients (44%) obtained vessel recanalization and the probability <br>of recanalization of the occluded vessels was 50% at 18 months. At <br>univariate analysis, factors associated with a lack of recanalization <br>included <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> (p=0.004) and solid tumor (p=0.010). Only one death <br>was attributed to fatal bleeding whereas 31 patients died for causes not <br>related to <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> (cirrhosis, cancer). Conclusions: Our study <br>suggests the effectiveness of anticoagulant therapy (especially VKA), <br>leading to thrombus recanalization in 44% of patients with SVT. Notably, the <br>anticoagulant treatment was associated with a very low bleeding incidence <br>also in patients with major risk factors for bleeding (i.e. <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span>, <br>cancer or esophageal varices). Treatment algorithm and therapeutic decisions <br>were taken as a multidisciplinary team, able to adapt the individual <br>approach and avoid fatal complications.<br><br>RECORD 18<br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy: presentation <br>and management<br>Belnap L. Rodgers G.M. Cottam D. Zaveri H. Drury C. Surve A.<br>Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2016) 12:10 (1787-1794). Date of <br>Publication: 1 Dec 2016<br><br>Background <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is a serious problem with a high <br>morbidity and mortality, often exceeding 40% of affected patients. Recently, <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span> has been reported in patients after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy <br>(LSG). The frequency is surprisingly high compared with other abdominal <br>operations. Objective We present a series of 5 patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> after LSG. <br>The treatment was not restricted simply to <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> alone, but was <br>determined by the extent of disease. A distinction is made among <br>nonocclusive, high-grade nonocclusive, and occlusive <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. We present <br>evidence that systemic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> is insufficient in occlusive <br>thrombosis and may also be insufficient in high-grade nonocclusive disease. <br>Setting Single private institution, United States. Methods We present a <br>retrospective analysis of 646 patients who underwent LSG between 2012 and <br>2015. In all patients, the diagnosis was established with an abdominal <br>computed tomography (CT) scan as well as duplex ultrasound of the portal <br>venous system. All patients received systemic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. Depending on <br>the extent of disease, thrombolytic therapy and portal vein thrombectomy <br>were utilized. All patients received long-term <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. Results Four <br>patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> were identified. A fifth patient with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> after LSG was <br>referred from another center. The mean age of all patients was 49 years. One <br>patient had a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). No complications were <br>identified intraoperatively or during the hospital stay, and all patients <br>were discharged by postoperative day 2. The patients presented with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> at <br>an average of 20 days (range: 10–35) post-LSG. The CT scan was positive for <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span> in all patients. In stable noncirrhotic patients with nonocclusive <br>disease, we administered therapeutic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. One patient with <br>high-grade, nonocclusive <span style="color: red">PVT</span> received <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> alone. Patients with <br>occlusive disease were treated with operative thrombectomy including <br>intraoperative and postoperative thrombolysis (tissue plasminogen activator) <br>with subsequent therapeutic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, followed by oral warfarin or a <br>factor Xa inhibitor. There was 1 death from multisystem organ failure in the <br>patient who was referred from another institution with occlusive disease, <br>initially managed only with an <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> infusion. Conclusions We <br>maintain that portal vein patency is essential to normal gastrointestinal <br>physiology and should be the treatment goal in all patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. In <br>these patients, the therapeutic option should be guided by the extent of the <br>thrombosis. In view of currently available approaches, we propose that <br>operative portal vein thrombectomy, in conjunction with fibrinolysis and <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, offers the best long-term success in patients with <br>occlusive <span style="color: red">PVT</span>.<br><br>RECORD 19<br>Cavernous sinus thrombosis and meckel diverticular bleed associated with <br>fusobacterium bacteremia<br>Azadeh N. Wilson J. Karnatovskaia L.<br>Critical Care Medicine (2016) 44:12 Supplement 1 (515). Date of Publication: <br>1 Dec 2016<br><br>Learning Objectives: Sinovenous thrombosis is a rare complication of <br>Fusobacterium necrophorum infection, often associated with septic <br>thrombophlebitis or Lemierre's syndrome. Meckel's diverticulum is uncommon <br>and often clinically silent. We present a case of septic sinovenous <br>thrombosis associated with Meckel's diverticular bleed. Methods: A 19 year <br>old male with recurrent otitis media and chronic sinusitis was admitted to <br>the intensive care unit with septic shock after a prodrome of sore throat, <br>headache, and photophobia for 1 week. He was initiated on broad spectrum <br>antibiotics for possible meningoencephalitis. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis <br>revealed a neutrophilic pleocytosis, but cultures were negative. Within 21 <br>hours, blood cultures grew F. necrophorum. Computed tomography (CT) with <br>contrast and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the head and neck were only <br>significant for complete opacification of the right sphenoid sinus. He <br>continued to have severe headaches. MR angiography and venography revealed <br>cavernous sinus thrombosis. On hospital day 3, he developed hematochezia <br>associated with a 3 g/dl drop in hemoglobin. Upper and lower endoscopies <br>were unremarkable. A triple phase abdominal CT revealed Meckel's <br>diverticulum. He underwent surgical resection (pathology showed focal <br>ulceration and gastric heterotopia), was started on <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, and <br>completed 6 weeks of antibiotics with a good clinical outcome. Results: <br>Intracranial complications of F. necrophorum include sinovenous thrombosis, <br>meningitis, and cerebral abscess. Sinovenous thrombosis is usually thought <br>of in the setting of Lemierre's syndrome/ thrombophlebitis of the internal <br>jugular veins, or more commonly in the setting of otogenic infection. <br>Primary foci of F. necrophorum infection in other sites are uncommon but can <br>occur in the urogenital or gastrointestinal (GI) tracts; portal vein <br>thrombosis and liver abscess have been described. Oral ulcers are a reported <br>complication of necrobacillosis; however, ulcers of the GI tract, namely <br>Meckel's diverticulum, have not previously been reported in this setting.<br><br>RECORD 20<br>Progression of Thrombus in Portal Vein, Superior Mesenteric Vein, and <br>Splenic Vein even on <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in a Patient with Ascending Colonic <br>Malignancy with Liver Metastasis: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> versus Portal Vein <br>Tumor Thrombosis<br>Sule A.

Budd-Chiari <br>syndrome (BCS) and <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> were diagnosed in 31 (17.1%) and <br>109 (60.3%) patients, respectively; isolated thrombosis of the mesenteric or <br>splenic veins was detected in 18 and 23 cases, respectively.

Date of <br>Publication: 1 Nov 2016<br><br>Background/Objectives: PEG-asparaginase leads to plasma asparagine depletion <br>and hepatotoxicity causing decreased synthesis of pro-coagulant and <br>anti-coagulant proteins. Thrombotic complications have been reported in 3-5% <br>of paediatric patients, with majority of the events related to either <br>central nervous system or central venous catheters (CVC). Design/Methods: <br>Case report of a rare thrombotic event following PEG-asparaginase <br>administration and brief literature review. Results: An 18-year-old male <br>with a poorly-differentiated lymphoblastic leukaemia (favoring T-cell) was <br>treated with four drug induction regimen (prednisone, daunorubicin, <br>vincristine and PEG-asparaginase). Five days following PEG-asparaginase, <br>Doppler ultrasonography showed an acute occlusive superficial cephalic vein <br>thrombus. Simultaneously, he also developed cramping epigastric/abdominal <br>pain. Computed tomography imaging performed 12 days after PEG-asparaginase <br>administration showed a moderate/large splenic infarct and portal vein <br>branch thrombosis. At our institution, fibrinogen levels, antithrombin (AT) <br>activity, prothrombin time (PT/INR) and activated partial thromboplastin <br>time (aPTT) are monitored following PEG-asparaginase administration in <br>adolescents and young adults. His evaluation two days prior to detection of <br>the splenic infarct showed low fibrinogen (<50 mg/dl), elevated INR (2.8; <br>range 0.8-1.2 sec) and aPTT levels (59 sec; range 28-38 sec). Following <br>imaging studies, additional labs included low AT activity (44%; range <br>80-130%). Management was supportive with blood products. Eleven days later, <br>imaging studies revealed worsening splenic infarct and a new CVC related <br>acute deep vein thrombosis. Low molecular weight heparin was started (target <br>heparin level of 0.5-1.0 IU/ml). Antithrombin concentrates and <br>cryoprecipitate were administered when AT activity <60% and fibrinogen <50 <br>mg/dl respectively, and PEG-asparaginase therapy was continued. No further <br>thrombotic or bleeding complications were observed. Conclusion: Adolescents <br>and young adults receiving PEG-asparaginase are at increased risk of <br>thrombosis and bleeding. Monitoring of PT, aPTT, fibrinogen, and AT activity <br>is recommended.

Date of Publication: 1 Nov 2016<br><br>There is no established standard therapy for duodenal variceal bleeding, and <br>the treatment-related complications are not well known. We describe a case <br>of symptomatic portal biliopathy and pylephlebitis after duodenal varix <br>obliteration using an injection of cyanoacrylate. A 55-year-old man <br>presented with melena. Esophagogastroscopy findings showed large duodenal <br>varices with stigmata of recent bleeding; thus, cyanoacrylate was injected <br>to achieve hemostasis. The patient was discharged from the hospital without <br>additional signs of bleeding. Four months later, he developed a fever and <br>abdominal pain.

He was successfully treated with antibiotics and endoscopic <br>biliary stenting. Our case suggests that once a patient presents with <br>duodenal variceal bleeding, physicians should consider treatment options and <br>their associated complications, especially when endoscopic sclerotherapy is <br>planned. Additionally, when patients present with fever, jaundice, and <br>abdominal pain after endoscopic sclerotherapy, septic thrombophlebitis and <br>symptomatic portal biliopathy should be considered.

To identify the risk factors <br>for <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, we analyzed the clinical characteristics and complications <br>associated with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in cirrhotic patients. Methods We studied patients with <br><span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> who were admitted to our unit from April 2009 to December <br>2014. The patients were divided into the <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and non-<span style="color: red">PVT</span> groups, and were <br>compared by variables including gender, age, the etiology of cirrhosis, <br>stage of cirrhosis, complications, imaging, and treatment. Results <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was <br>found in 45 (9.8%) of 461 cirrhotic patients admitted to our hospital. Most <br>patients (45.9%) had hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cirrhosis, with a <br>similar distribution of etiologies between the groups. However, there was no <br>positive relationship between <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and etiologies of cirrhosis. Most patients <br>(71.5%) were in the stage of hepatic decompensation. No statistically <br>significant differences were found in complications including esophageal <br>varices, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy between the groups.

Methods: This retrospective chart review collected patient <br>data including the prothrombin time international normalized ratio (PT-INR). <br>Patients were categorized into three groups based on the timing of WF <br>administration in relation to S-1 oral chemotherapy: group A patients <br>received WF before S-1 chemotherapy; group B patients started WF during S-1 <br>chemotherapy; and group C patients started WF after completing S-1 <br>chemotherapy. Results: A total of 21 patients with gastric cancer were <br>included in the study; group A (n = 8), group B (n = 10) and group C (n = <br>3).

A total of seven studies qualified <br>for the review, involving 383 and 283 patients receiving or not receiving <br>regular prophylactic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, respectively. The incidence of PVST <br>was significantly reduced with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.31 [95% confidence <br>interval (CI), 0.21-0.46; P<0.00001] in the regular prophylactic <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> group compared with the control group.

Malik S. Sohail U.<br>American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016) 111 Supplement 1 (S616-S617). <br>Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2016<br><br>Introduction: Thrombophlebitis in mesenteric and portal vein is a rare <br>complication of intra-abdominal inflammatory process. The condition has high <br>mortality and morbidity. We present an unusual case of a patient presenting <br>with features of acute abdomen and was found to have acute mesenteric <br>thrombophlebitis. Case Presentation: A 72 year old female with history of <br>diabetes mellitus and hypertension presented to hospital with complains of <br>left lower quadrant pain and fever for seven days. The pain was associated <br>with anorexia and malaise. No symptoms of vomiting, hematochezia or bowel <br>habit changes. No family history of clotting disorder. On presentation her <br>vitals were unremarkable except low grade fever and left lower quadrant <br>tenderness. Investigations showed WBC 10.7 thousand/ml. CT scan of abdomen/ <br>pelvis showed thrombosis of mesenteric vein extending from the proximal <br>sigmoid colon to a tributary of the superior mesenteric vein along with mild <br>inflammatory changes surrounding the thrombosed vein. There was colonic <br>diverticulosis without diverticulitis. Blood cultures were negative. Patient <br>was treated with flagyl and ciprofloxacin. She was started on <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> with IV heparin and discharged on oral rivaroxaban. <br>Discussion: Infected thrombosis of portal vein and its tributaries is called <br>pylephlebitis. It is most commonly caused by diverticulitis, appendicitis, <br>inflammatory bowel disease and pancreatitis. Most common symptoms include <br>fever and abdominal pain. CT scan is the modality of choice to diagnose the <br>condition. In our patient there were no signs of diverticulitis on CT scan <br>but patient symptoms and presence of diverticuli in sigmoid region suggest <br>patient recently developed diverticulitis which resolved by time of <br>presentation to hospital. Most common organism causing pylephlebitis include <br>bactroides fragalis, followed by E. coli, Strep viridans and klebsiella <br>pneumonia. The patients should be treated with empiric broad spectrum <br>antibiotics. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> improves long term outcome of pylephlebitis in <br>terms of lower mortality and development of portal hypertension and septic <br>embolization to liver. The duration of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> is variable but some <br>studies suggest <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> for 2 months. Conclusion: Mesenteric vein <br>thrombophlebitis is rare but fatal complication of intra-abdominal <br>inflammatory process and usually presents with nonspecific symptoms. Early <br>diagnosis and prompt treatment can prevent long term complications.<br><br>RECORD 32<br>PNH: A rare hematological disease with profound implications for a <br>gastroenterologist<br>Sunkara T. Parvataneni S. Ajdir N. Vigoda I. Fulger I. Gaduputi V.<br>American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016) 111 Supplement 1 (S908). Date of <br>Publication: 1 Oct 2016<br><br>Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare thrombophilic and <br>hematopoietic stem cell disorder with an annual incidence rate of as low as <br>1-2 cases per million. About 16% of these patients present with visceral <br>vein thrombosis which is the most common cause of mortality. We here present <br>an extremely rare case of a young man presenting with extensive thrombosis <br>of multiple visceral veins from PNH. A 36-year-old Hispanic man with no <br>significant medical history presented to the emergency department with <br>diffuse abdominal pain of four days duration. The patient also reported <br>weight loss of 5lbs over the preceding one month. Initial laboratory tests <br>revealed transaminitis; and pancytopenia with reticulocytosis, increased <br>serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and decreased serum haptoglobin levels. <br>The patient was found to have elevated urobilinogen in urine pointing <br>towards intravascular hemolysis. A computerized tomography (CT) scan <br>(Figure-1) of the abdomen demonstrated extensive <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> <br>(<span style="color: red">PVT</span>), superior mesenteric vein thrombosis and bilateral renal vein <br>thrombosis. Flow cytometry and bone marrow biopsy (Figure-2) confirmed the <br>diagnosis of PNH. The patient underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy for <br>screening esophageal varices. No varices were found. The patient was started <br>on <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> and Eculizumab. PNH caused by mutation of the PIG-A gene, <br>is characterized by uncontrolled complement activity with decreased CD-55 <br>and 59 levels leading to- intravascular hemolysis, thrombosis, and bone <br>marrow failure. Patients with PNH often present with hemoglobinuria, <br>abdominal pain, fever, headache, and fatigue. While hepatic and cerebral <br>veins are the most common sites of thrombosis, <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is extremely rare with <br>only about 12 cases reported in the literature. Sparing of hepatic vein with <br>involvement of portal vein and mesenteric veins makes this case highly <br>unusual. A gastroenterologist must be keenly aware and consider the <br>diagnosis of PNH in any young patient presenting with abdominal pain and <br>hemolysis with abdominal visceral vein thrombosis, especially in the absence <br>of underlying cirrhosis. It is imperative that these patients are started on <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> at the earliest given the high mortality. Eculizumab is a <br>monoclonal antibody used in the secondary prevention of disease known to act <br>by inhibiting the activation of complement cascade system.

Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2016<br><br>Background and aims: Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is characterized by <br>hypoxemia and intrapulmonary vascular dilatations in patients with liver <br>disease. The pathogenesis of HPS is poorly understood. Liver changes <br>associated with HPS have not been studied. The aim of this study was to <br>describe imaging and pathology changes associated with HPS. Patients and <br>methods: We performed a monocentric retrospective case-control study. We <br>included all patients having undergone a liver transplantation assessment <br>between 1997 and 2015 with a pretransplantation diagnosis of alcoholic, <br>viral or cryptogenetic cirrhosis associated with HPS, defined as PaO(4) ≤ 70 <br>mm Hg and a “positive” contrast-enhanced echocardiography. Each case was <br>matched for age, cause and severity of the liver disease to 3 controls. All <br>controls had PaO(4) ≥ 85 mm Hg on room air. Expert radiologist and <br>pathologist, unaware of clinical and laboratory data, reviewed <br>pretransplantation thoracic and abdominal imaging (contrast-enhanced MDCT <br>and Doppler ultrasound) as well as explanted livers, according to predefined <br>questionnaires. Results: 21 CT-scans and 19 explanted livers from patients <br>with HPS were compared to 63 CT-scans and 57 livers from controls, <br>respectively. Age, cause and severity of cirrhosis were similar between both <br>groups. At imaging, compared with controls, patients with HPS more <br>frequently had abnormal intrahepatic portal vein branches (i.e. reduced in <br>caliber and/or not visible) (24% vs. 60%; p=0.03), stagnant or hepafugal <br>portal blood flow (27% vs. 57%; p=0.05) and large portosystemic collaterals <br>(25% vs. 65%; p=0.01), including larger paraumbilical vein diameter (2.0 vs. <br>4.5 mm; p=0.01). Hepatic artery diameter was also larger (5.6 vs. 7.0 mm; <br>p=0.001). At pathology, compared with controls, patients with HPS more <br>frequently had liver parenchymal extinction (28% vs. 53%; p=0.05), <br>incomplete septal cirrhosis (2% vs. 16%; p=0.046), intrahepatic portal vein <br>thrombosis (12% vs. 47%; p=0.001), thickening or obstruction of <br>centrilobular veins (40% vs. 63%; p=0.025), sinusoidal dilatation (44% vs. <br>74%; p=0.048) and vascular proliferation in fibrous bands (72% vs. 95%; <br>p=0.001). Conclusion: HPS is associated with imaging and pathology evidence <br>of small portal vein obstructions, and with increased portosystemic shunting <br>and larger hepatic artery. This results suggest that intrahepatic portal <br>vein obstructions lead to the release by the ischemic liver of <br>pro-angiogenic/vasodilatatory mediators responsible for the intrapulmonary <br>vascular dilatations characteristic for HPS. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> might thus be <br>useful in HPS patients.<br><br>RECORD 34<br>Recurrent hepatic artery and <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> leading to graft loss <br>after liver transplantation in patient with antiphospholipid syndrome<br>Sobotka L.

A liver doppler showed a grossly patent portal <br>vein (PV) with elevated flow velocity but no detectable flow in the main <br>hepatic artery (HA). The patient was emergently taken to the operating room <br>for an explorative laparotomy with thrombectomy of the HA and PV. Following <br>thrombectomy, intraoperative ultrasound confirmed patent blood flow in both <br>the HA and PV. Unfortunately, the patient's labs continued to worsen with <br>ALT peaking at 3080, AST to 2066, total bilirubin 5.5, and INR 6.4. Repeat <br>liver doppler was concerning for recurrent thrombosis. Figure 1 depicts the <br>left HA doppler and Figure 2 shows the right HA doppler. The patient was <br>emergently re-listed for transplant as status 1A and underwent repeat OLT. <br>Notably, the main HA and PV in the initial graft were found to be <br>re-thrombosed. Due to concern for antiphospholipid syndrome, the patient was <br>continued on heparin drip but also started on aspirin post-operatively. <br>Serologic testing for lupus anticoagulant was positive and anti-cardiolipin <br>antibody IgG was weakly positive. The patient's remaining hospital course <br>was uncomplicated and he was transitioned to warfarin with an INR goal of <br>2.5 to 3.0 and continued on aspirin. At 1-year post-transplant follow-up, <br>the patient was doing well and still maintained on aspirin and warfarin. <br>Discussion: HA thrombosis (HAT) is a major cause of graft loss and mortality <br>following OLT. This case illustrates a rare instance of recurrent HA and PV <br>thrombosis following OLT. When recurrent HAT occurs, screening for an <br>undergoing hypercoagulable condition is indicated. Based on the patient's <br>clinical and laboratory evaluation, he does meet diagnostic criteria for <br>antiphospholipid syndrome. He did have additional risk factor for HAT <br>including negative recipient CMV status in the recipient. He was able to be <br>managed with aspirin and warfarin for <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> following his second <br>OLT without evidence of recurrent thrombosis.

Date of <br>Publication: 1 Oct 2016<br><br>This is a case of extensive vein thrombosis including Budd Chiari syndrome <br>(BCS) that led to acute liver failure and diagnosis of Polycythemia Vera. It <br>is important to recognize hypercoagulable conditions in patients presenting <br>with BCS. Polycythemia Vera (PCV) is increasingly reported as a culprit in <br>BCS patients. 71-year-old female with recent history of right Internal <br>jugular (IJ) thrombosis, brachiocephalic thrombosis. She presented with <br>two-week history of worsening abdominal swelling, peripheral edema.

This syndrome often occurs in <br>hypercoagulable states especially when oral contraceptives are on board. <br>Polycythemia Vera, described as clonal proliferation of myeloid cells <br>distinguished by elevated red cell mass, has been reported in literature as <br>a cause of BCS. Venous thrombosis is not infrequent in PCV. Studies showing <br>prevalence of JAK2 activation in BCS. While primary myeloproliferative <br>diseases were leading causes of portal and hepatic vein thromboses in other <br>studies. This case sheds the light on how drastic PCV can present. Acute <br>liver failure caused by BCS might warrant work up for hypercoagulable status <br>and PCV.

She was diagnosed with mesenteric vein <br>thrombosis in 1995 after she developed acute onset of severe abdominal pain. <br>She required exploratory laparotomy at which time the diagnosis was made and <br>was treated with warfarin for six months. She underwent hypercoagulable <br>workup which was negative. In 2003, she was noted to have extension of the <br>superior mesenteric vein (SMV) thrombus into the portal vein. She was <br>restarted on warfarin which she remains on. She has a history of esophageal <br>and fundal varices on propranolol 600 mg daily. The varices were never <br>treated endoscopically and she denies history of gastrointestinal bleeding. <br>She has not had prior liver biopsy. Family history is negative for venous <br>thromboembolism. Social history is negative for alcohol use. She has two <br>healthy children and no history of miscarriage. Review of systems is <br>negative for jaundice, icterus, pruritus, encephalopathy, ascites, or <br>peripheral edema. On exam, abdomen is distended but soft and nontender. <br>Splenomegaly is present and there is no obvious ascites. There are no <br>chronic liver disease stigmata. Labs are significant for a platelet count of <br>80, normal liver function tests, normal albumin, and elevated INR in the <br>setting of warfarin. MRI of liver with elastography reveals cavernous <br>transformation of the intra- and extrahepatic portal veins with a prominent <br>system of pericholecystic collaterals.

Stephens M. Mott N.<br>Journal of Medical Imaging and Radiation Oncology (2016) 60 Supplement 1 <br>(30-31). Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2016<br><br>Learning objectives: To present the clinical indications and procedure <br>details of transjugular intra-hepatic porto-systemic shunts (TIPS), and <br>discuss technique challenges, complications, follow-up and future avenues. <br>Background: The TIPS procedure has an established role in managing the <br>sequelae of portal hypertension (1). The American Association for the Study <br>of Liver Disease recommends TIPS for management of variceal bleeding when <br>pharmacologic and endoscopic therapy fails, refractory ascites in patients <br>intolerant of repeated drainage, hydrothorax refractory to salt-restriction <br>and diuresis, and moderately severe Budd-Chiari syndrome not responsive to <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> (2). TIPS has also been shown to improve renal function in <br>hepatorenal syndrome, however its indication in this condition is still <br>under investigation (3). Although TIPS is not a curative procedure, there is <br>an emerging understanding that it can delay mortality and serve as a bridge <br>to liver transplant (4). Another potential application is treatment and <br>prevention of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>), where TIPS functions to maintain <br>portal vein flow (5). This is significant because the low-flow state in <br>cirrhosis predisposes to <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, and <span style="color: red">PVT</span> complicates conventional end-to-end <br>portal vein anastomosis in liver transplant (6). Procedure details: The <br>procedure initially involves transjugular access of hepatic veins, passage <br>of a guide-needle through liver parenchyma into a portal vein branch and <br>measurement of the portosystemic gradient. Following balloon-dilatation of <br>the tract created, a sheath is advanced over the guide-needle and the stent <br>deployed. Serial dilatations are performed until satisfactory decompression <br>is achieved and adjunct variceal embolization performed if required. (7) The <br>most technically challenging step is portal vein access, which can be <br>further complicated by anatomical variation (8). Prior evaluation of the <br>vascular beds involved with cross-sectional imaging is helpful, and <br>ultrasound and wedge CO(2) or contrast portography can aid portal vein <br>targeting intra-procedure (9). Acute complications include intra-peritoneal <br>haemorrhage, acute liver failure secondary to ischemia from portal flow <br>diversion, cardiac failure from increased pre-load and contrast nephropathy <br>(10). The most commonly discussed long-term complication is hepatic <br>encephalopathy as portal blood is shunted into the systemic circulation (7). <br>Since the introduction of poly-tetraflouroethylene stents, stenosis and <br>thrombosis are rare (5). Doppler ultrasound is performed post-procedure to <br>assess shunt flow, and three-monthly for surveillance. Venography is <br>performed as indicated. (10) Conclusion: TIPS, whilst not a curative <br>procedure, is a valued intervention in managing portal hypertension. It <br>shows promise in becoming an accepted means of widening the window for liver <br>transplant and management of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in transplant candidates.<br><br>RECORD 38<br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> as a complication of liver biopsy<br>Levin N. Brown C. Zucker S.<br>American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016) 111 Supplement 1 (S942). Date of <br>Publication: 1 Oct 2016<br><br>Liver biopsy and histologic examination remain the gold standard for <br>evaluation of elevated liver tests. Reported complications of liver biopsy <br>include pain, bleeding, infection, bile leak and rarely hepatic <br>arteriovenous fistula. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first <br>reported case of liver biopsy precipitating <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. A 64 <br>year-old female with a history of remote cholecystectomy and chronic <br>aminotransferase elevation [baseline AST 30-50 IU/L (reference 0-32 IU/L), <br>ALT 30-50 IU/L (ref. 0-33 IU/L) and alkaline phosphatase 140-170 IU/L (ref. <br>35-105 IU/L)] was admitted for complaints of worsening right upper quadrant <br>abdominal pain occurring approximately one week following a percutaneous <br>liver biopsy. The procedure involved three biopsies of the right hepatic <br>lobe under ultrasound guidance with a 16-gauge instrument. Post-procedure, <br>an ultrasound of the liver demonstrated no evidence of free fluid or hepatic <br>hematoma. The biopsy revealed mild chronic hepatitis, mild portal chronic <br>inflammation with mild interface hepatitis (grade 2/4), mild lobular <br>inflammation with no hepatocellular death (grade 1/4) and mildly enlarged <br>fibrotic portal tracts with no periportal or portal-portal septae, <br>architectural distortion or cirrhosis (stage 1/4 per Scheuer). The patient <br>denied jaundice, nausea, vomiting, fever, hematemesis or bloody stools. <br>Work-up was notable for AST and ALT elevation to 70 IU/L and 89 IU/L <br>respectively, alkaline phosphatase of 228 IU/L and normal bilirubin. Vital <br>signs were within normal range; her abdominal exam was significant for mild <br>tenderness to palpation of the right upper quadrant and a small hematoma <br>noted at the anterior axillary line in the 9th rib space. Multiphasic <br>abdominal CT was performed, demonstrating a tubular hypodensity within the <br>posterior right liver consistent with thrombus in the posterior branch of <br>the right portal vein with altered perfusion of the posterior right hepatic <br>lobe [Figure 1]. Based on the acuity of pain and location of the portal vein <br>thrombosis, we concluded the thrombosis was likely induced by injury to the <br>posterior branch of the right portal vein following percutaneous liver <br>biopsy. For this reason, the patient did not undergo any hypercoagulability <br>testing; <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was not indicated. After brief observation, her <br>labs improved to baseline and her pain resolved. This case demonstrates that <br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> may be a complication of a percutaneous liver biopsy. <br>(Figure Presented).<br><br>RECORD 39<br>It takes two to make a thing go right: A GI and hematology collaboration to <br>diagnose an atypical cause of abdominal pain and GI bleeding<br>Mendez V. Bade K.S. Moehlen M.<br>American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016) 111 Supplement 1 (S978-S979). <br>Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2016<br><br>A 20-year-old African American man with history of aplastic anemia presented <br>as a transfer for evaluation for a bone marrow transplant. GI was consulted <br>to evaluate abdominal pain and bloody stool. He initially presented to an <br>outside facility with worsening, nonradiating epigastric abdominal pain with <br>associated “dark stool” and nausea with nonbloody emesis of one month <br>duration. He denied diarrhea, bloody stool or similar episodes. Initial work <br>up included a contrasted CT of abdomen and pelvis that showed bowel wall <br>thickening in mid-distal duodenum and terminal ileum. A small bowel <br>enteroscopy showed a hemorrhagic mass vs. necrotic ulcer with an adherent <br>clot in the second/third portion of the duodenum. Biopsies revealed <br>“features suggestive of ischemic mucosal injury, negative for dysplasia or <br>malignancy.” He was treated supportively with narcotics, stool softeners, a <br>proton pump inhibitor and sucralfate. He was transferred to our facility <br>after failure to improve. Initial blood work included flow cytometry, which <br>revealed a population of PNH clones. With worsening abdominal pain and new <br>onset rectal bleeding, there was concern for an ischemic process. A repeat <br>CT showed wall thickening in a 14cm segment of the distal ileum and a 5cm <br>portion of the jejunum. There was concern for thrombosis in a peripheral <br>segment of the right hepatic vein. He was started on eculizumab and a <br>heparin drip, with clinical improvement and resolution of rectal bleeding. <br>PNH is a rare condition occurring in 1-10 per million people. It typically <br>presents with fatigue, jaundice, red urine and hemolysis, and can present <br>with complications from thrombosis, such as abdominal pain and stroke. The <br>leading cause of death in patients with PNH is thrombosis. Thromboses are <br>more often seen in the hepatic, portal and mesenteric veins and may rarely <br>cause ulcerations similar to those in our patient. Some patients with PNH <br>have an overlap syndrome with bone marrow disorders, such as aplastic <br>anemia, as well as other cytopenias and myelodysplastic syndrome. Clinicians <br>must have high suspicion to diagnose mesenteric vein thrombosis, which is <br>most commonly done with contrasted CT showing bowel wall thickening, with or <br>without portal vein thrombus. Treatment is usually <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in acute <br>and subacute cases. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> is not necessary in chronic thrombosis <br>which have progressed to form collaterals with associated portal hypotension <br>and varices.

Saline L.C. Powers D.W. Sobrado J.<br>American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016) 111 Supplement 1 (S1349-S1350). <br>Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2016<br><br>The portal vein is formed by the superior mesenteric vein and splenic vein. <br>Thrombosis within this vessel may occur acutely or chronically over time due <br>to hepatic cirrhosis or other pro-thrombotic disorders. While provoking <br>agents and initial symptoms are variable, the common pathology involves <br>general flow obstruction within the portal vasculature with possible new or <br>worsening liver failure, portal hypertension, or intestinal ischemia. Our <br>patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of ethanol abuse, who <br>presented to the ER with progressive dyspnea and was admitted with <br>community-acquired pneumonia. On admission, the patient denied any pain and <br>had a benign abdominal exam. Due to an INR of 4.1, the GI service was <br>consulted for suspected cirrhosis. An abdominal US was obtained and showed a <br>near complete thrombosis of the portal and superior mesenteric veins. This <br>was confirmed by an abdominal CT, which also revealed numerous ill-defined <br>masses throughout the liver and at the head of the pancreas. An initial <br>liver biopsy showed no evidence of malignancy but revealed acute and chronic <br>inflammation, microabscess formation, and coagulation necrosis. A second <br>liver biopsy corroborated an infectious etiology when 220 mL of perihepatic <br>purulent fluid was collected. As the etiology of the hepatic and pancreatic <br>lesions was investigated, the proposed mechanism of thrombus formation was <br>attributed to the multiple pancreatic lesions compressing and potentiating <br>venous stasis of the nearby vasculature. Treatment was geared toward <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> initially with full dose lovenox and then with heparin. <br>After 2 weeks of treatment, a repeat CT of the abdomen showed no further <br>evidence of thrombus within the portal vein and <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was <br>discontinued. This case demonstrates a unique pathologic process and <br>etiology of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> as attributed to venous stasis secondary <br>from abscesses within the liver and pancreatic head. Although the patient <br>presented with a known history of ethanol abuse, she had no abdominal <br>ascites, GI upset, or pain on admission. Coagulopathy was the only aberrant <br>factor that prompted investigation of hepatic pathology. While many factors <br>are known to promote or exacerbate thrombus formation within the portal <br>system, the infectious etiology in this case has been rarely observed within <br>the literature and therefore underscores the variable symptomatology of this <br>condition and the high clinical suspicion necessary for its detection.<br><br>RECORD 41<br>Antiphospholipid antibodies associated vascular events are an <br>underrecognized cause of morbidity and mortality after liver <br>transplantation: Benefit of plasmapheresis and <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in <br>transplanted patients with high thrombotic risk<br>Villamil A.

Patients and Methods: Between 2005 and 2015 <br>321 patients transplanted for end-stage liver disease were screened for <br>aPL-ab and lupus anticoagulant activity. 86/321 patients (27%) had increased <br>levels of aPL-ab (anticardiolipin IgM and/ or IgG isotypes, anti Beta-2 <br>glycoprotein) and/or lupus anticoagulant activity. 29/86 fulfilled high <br>thrombotic risk criteria and were randomly divided in 2 groups: Group A <br>(n=12): patients with standard low dose aspirin ± low weight heparin <br>post-OLT. Group B (n=17): patients with 1-2 hours pre-OLT plasmapheresis <br>with fresh frozen plasma followed by post OLT <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> for at least 3 <br>months.

Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2016<br><br>Purpose: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) in cirrhosis leads to worsening of <br>liver disease, poorer clinical outcomes, and potential inoperability at <br>liver transplantation (LT). Prevalence of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in patients undergoing <br>transplantation or evaluation for transplantation is between 5% to 16%. The <br>purpose of this study is to develop a <span style="color: red">PVT</span> risk prediction model in cirrhotic <br>patients awaiting LT. Methods: An analysis of patients waitlisted for liver <br>transplantation and undergoing serial cross-sectional evaluation of portal <br>and hepatic vessels from 12/1987 to 5/2014 was performed in the in a large, <br>prospectively constructed electronic data warehouse. A total of 621 patients <br>were identified with baseline assessment and subsequent imaging. Descriptive <br>statistics were computed. Patients were divided randomly into derivation and <br>validation populations using a 70% versus 30% split.

Dantzler T.<br>American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016) 111 Supplement 1 (S1372). Date <br>of Publication: 1 Oct 2016<br><br>Pylephlebitis is regarded as a septic thrombophlebitis of the portal vein or <br>one of its tributaries and is commonly associated with intra-abdominal <br>infection. Diagnosis can be difficult as its presentation is commonly <br>associated with non-specific symptoms such as generalized abdominal pain and <br>fever. Given its high morbidity and mortality rates and its low incidence, a <br>high index of suspicion is needed to make the diagnosis and avoid a delay in <br>treatment. A 39-year-old female with a medical history notable for an <br>episode of pancreatitis complicated by pseudocyst and pancreatic duct leak <br>requiring endoscopic transpapillary drainage initially presented to an <br>outside hospital with progressively worsening right upper quadrant abdominal <br>pain and malaise. A CT of the abdomen was performed and was notable for <br>possible pancreatic cancer involving the head of the pancreas and metastasis <br>to the liver. She was referred to our institution for endoscopic ultrasound <br>with fine needle aspiration (FNA) for further evaluation. FNA of the lesions <br>was notable for likely hepatic abscess, and after the procedure, the patient <br>experienced a temperature of 103.1°, heart rate of 121 and rigors. She was <br>subsequently admitted for further evaluation. MRI was performed for <br>characterization of the pancreas and hepatic lesions and was notable for <br>extensive <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> to the level of portal confluence with <br>findings suggestive of superimposed thrombophlebitis. Percutaneous drainage <br>of one the hepatic abscesses and blood cultures isolated peptostreptococcus <br>micros. Ultimately, the patient was treated with a fourweek course of <br>ertapenum. Due to the extensive clot burden, the patient was also placed on <br>a heparin drip with transition over to warfarin by the time of discharge. <br>The incidence of pylephlebitis has been reportedly as low as 0.6 % with a <br>mortality upwards of 32 %. As its presentation is related to relatively <br>nonspecific symptoms (abdominal pain, fevers, nausea), diagnosis can be <br>difficult. The absence of a high index of suspicion can lead to a delay in <br>diagnosis. Blood cultures with enteric organisms can assist with raising the <br>index of suspicion and guiding antibiotic therapy, but CT and ultrasound <br>should be used to appropriately visualize the portal vasculature. <br>Ultimately, patients should be treated with a parenteral course of <br>antibiotics and the role of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> should be discussed on a <br>case-by-case basis as there is no clear consensus on its role.

Gemella <br>infrequently causes endocarditis, cerebral abscess and empyema but is not <br>known to cause liver abscess. There are only 8 published cases. Case: A 59 <br>Year old female with no prior medical or travel history presented with 2 <br>weeks of generalized weakness, nausea, anorexia and cough with fevers and <br>chills. On examination, she was febrile and ill-appearing with a soft, non <br>tender abdomen. Lab results: WBC 27 K/mm3; liver enzymes: AST 49 U/L, ALT 54 <br>U/L, ALP 62 U/L; T. bili 0.3 mg/dl. Xray was unremarkable. Abdominal CT scan <br>revealed an 11×6 cm multiloculated liver abscess with associated thrombosis <br>of right portal vein and sigmoid diverticulosis. Initial therapy consisted <br>of IV carbapenem and <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. HIV, viral hepatitis and amoebic <br>antibodies were negative. Blood culture was negative and echocardiogram was <br>normal. On CT-directed aspiration of the liver lesion, 31 cc of thick green <br>fluid was evacuated which revealed acute inflammatory cells with necrosis <br>and no malignant cell. Fluid culture grew Gemella species. Intravenous <br>vancomycin was added. Although abscess decreased in size, high fevers <br>persisted, prompting pigtail catheter placement. She improved clinically and <br>was discharged with intravenous vancomycin and ertapenem for 4 weeks. Repeat <br>CT scan after one month showed resolution of liver abscess but revealed a <br>new 1.2x1.1 cm chronic intramural abscess in lateral wall of sigmoid colon. <br>She is scheduled for colonoscopy later. Conclusion: This case illustrates <br>the potential of Gemella species to cause liver abscess, including large <br>abscesses which may require catheter drainage and prolonged antibiotics, in <br>an immunocompetent noncirrhotic individual with diverticulosis. As Gemella <br>is a commensal in the gut, it likely translocated from chronic sigmoid <br>diverticulosis to the liver via portal vein, causing abscess formation. We <br>successfully treated with vancomycin and carbapenem. Data is limited <br>regarding management, given the rarity of this organism.

Kesar V. Shamah S. Swaminath A.<br>American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016) 111 Supplement 1 (S831). Date of <br>Publication: 1 Oct 2016<br><br>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an inflammatory state with an increased <br>risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Patients with IBD have a three-fold <br>higher risk of VTE compared to patients without IBD. This may occur due to <br>disequilibrium between procoagulant and anticoagulant factors, bacterial <br>translocation leading to portal pylephlebitis, or post-operative state. <br>Herein, we present a case of Crohn's disease with <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> <br>(<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) causing exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI). A 44 year-old man <br>with fistulizing and fibrostenosing Crohn's Disease since age 12 presented <br>with more than 10 bowel movements daily for 1 month. He was previously <br>treated with adalimumab for 4 years without improvement in subjective <br>symptoms, thus the patient self-discontinued medication at age 40. One year <br>prior to presentation, the patient had severe abdominal pain and was found <br>to have a peri-anal fistula and mid-transverse colonic stricture. He <br>underwent an elective resection of 14.5 cm of his transverse colon with <br>ileo-colonic anastomosis. On post-operative imaging, he was found to have <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span> and completed 3 months of lovenox. Three months post-operative, he <br>developed frequent non-bloody post-prandial diarrhea with early satiety and <br>vague abdominal discomfort. He was tried on cholestyramine with minimal <br>improvement. An EGD and colonoscopy to evaluate the diarrhea were <br>non-diagnostic. He was sent for a CT scan to rule out small bowel to colonic <br>fistula and was found to have extension of his portal vein thrombus from the <br>left hepatic vein to the splenic vein. In addition, the CT scan showed <br>atrophy of hepatic segments 6 and 7, but no evidence of pancreatitis. CBC <br>and serum tryptase were unremarkable. He had an elevated AST, ALT, and <br>alkaline phosphatase. He was started on pancrelipase and long-term <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> with rivaroxaban with rapid improvement in symptoms <br>consistent with EPI due to extension of the <span style="color: red">PVT</span> into venous drainage of the <br>pancreas. Active IBD is a risk factor for VTE. Here we describe a rare case <br>of persistent diarrhea in a patient with Crohn's disease due to EPI <br>associated with <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. This has rarely been described in the literature, but <br>the pathophysiology is thought to be due to <span style="color: red">PVT</span> leading to obstruction of <br>pancreatic venous drainage, causing pancreatic duct atrophy and exocrine <br>insufficiency. Thus, in IBD patients with a history of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and persistent <br>diarrhea it is important to consider EPI as an etiology.<br><br>RECORD 46<br>Streptococcal hepatic abscess: A rare complication of severe necrotizing <br>pancreatitis<br>Khurana S. Rahimi E. Nevah Rubin M.I. Kaila V. Guha S. Ashary N. Ertan A. <br>Thosani N.<br>American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016) 111 Supplement 1 (S591). Date of <br>Publication: 1 Oct 2016<br><br>A 60-year-old female was admitted with severe pancreatitis of unknown <br>etiology, with symptoms of epigastric abdominal pain, and nausea with <br>vomiting. Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed large areas <br>of non-enhancement of the pancreatic body, and extensive peripancreatic free <br>fluid and stranding in the regions of the pancreatic head and tail <br>consistent with acute necrotizing pancreatitis. She was also noted to have <br>non-occluding thrombi of the superior mesenteric vein that extended into the <br>portal vein and was started on long-term <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> treatment with oral <br>warfarin. Her clinical course was complicated by the development of a large <br>pancreatic pseudocyst (11 x 13 x 23 cm on CT) that was managed successfully <br>by endoscopic cystogastrostomy [Figure 1]. Unfortunately, after initial good <br>recovery, she was hospitalized 3 months later with ascites and failure to <br>thrive. A repeat contrast enhanced CT scan showed a large multi-loculated <br>7.4 x 7.8 x 9.2 cm mass in the liver involving caudate lobe, and right lobe <br>of liver concerning for hepatocellular carcinoma [Figure 2]. On endoscopic <br>ultrasound a large hypoechoic, heterogeneous mass was noted in the liver. <br>Fine needle aspiration using a 25G needle was performed and on site <br>evaluation by cytopathology showed extensive necrosis and acute inflammation <br>concerning for hepatic abscess. Additional FNA was performed for culture and <br>sensitivity that revealed gram-positive bacteria in clusters (Group F <br>streptococcus). Patient was treated with longterm intravenous vancomycin. <br>She had near complete resolution of liver abscess at 6-week follow-up. <br>Pancreatic pseudocyst and splenic vein thrombosis are the known <br>complications of severe pancreatitis. However, the development of a liver <br>abscess possibly following pylephlebitis in the background setting of acute <br>necrotizing pancreatitis is a rare entity with only a few cases reported in <br>the literature. Our patient developed severe hepatic abscess and ascites <br>mimicking hepatocellular cancer. Likely etiology of this abscess was <br>superior mesenteric vein and <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. This case highlights <br>the rare complication of severe necrotizing pancreatitis and role of EUS <br>guided tissue acquisition in diagnosis and management of hepatic abscess. <br>(Figure Presented).<br><br>RECORD 47<br>Budd-chiari syndrome and <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in crohn's disease<br>Ghouri Y.A. Shenoy A.V. Stevenson H.L. Merwat S.<br>American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016) 111 Supplement 1 (S815-S816). <br>Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2016<br><br>Introduction: Untreated Crohn's disease (CD) is a prothrombotic state <br>associated with venous thromboembolism and can present with portal vein <br>thrombosis, deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (PE). There are a <br>handful reported cases of CD presenting as hepatic vein thrombosis or <br>Budd-Chiari syndrome. Case description: A 27 year old male presented with <br>hematochezia, abdominal pain, anasarca with ascites, fatigue and <br>hepatomegaly. A year prior to presentation he developed hematochezia and was <br>seen at a different hospital where he underwent colonoscopy that was <br>suggestive of inflammatory bowel disease but was lost to follow up and <br>remained untreated and continued to have intermittent hematochezia and <br>abdominal pain. On admission his Hb was 5.7 g/dL with elevated ALT (83 U/L) <br>and AST (81 U/L) and albumin of 2.1 g/dL. Stool studies were negative for C <br>difficile toxins, ova & parasites, enteric cultures but positive for <br>leukocytes. Colonoscopy was performed that showed terminal ileitis and <br>pancolitis with rectal pseudopolyp formation. EGD demonstrated duodenal <br>ulcerations and inflammation of pylorus which on biopsy showed <br>non-necrotizing granuloma formation that was consistent with a diagnosis of <br>CD (Figure 1). His hypoalbuminemia was suspected to be due to protein-losing <br>enteropathy from active enterocolitis. Paracentesis of the ascitic fluid <br>showed a serum:ascites albumin gradient of >1.4 which suggested portal <br>hypertension. CT scan of abdomen demonstrated hepatomegaly with thrombi in <br>the inferior vena cava, portal vein and right hepatic vein (Figure 2). Liver <br>biopsy showed extensive perivenular sinusoidal dilation, areas of hepatocyte <br>atrophy and drop-out, and mild centrizonal fibrosis (Budd-Chiari syndrome; <br>Figure 3). He was then anti-coagulated with heparin drip and transitioned to <br>apixiban. His anasarca improved with diuretics and CD was treated with <br>prednisone and mesalamine at the time of discharge. Discussion: Active CD is <br>a prothrombotic state that can lead to Budd-Chiari syndrome and subsequent <br>hepatocyte injury as a result of venous congestion. Protein losing <br>enteropathy can develop as a result of untreated CD leading to anasarca and <br>loss of procoagulant factors which further increases the risk of venous <br>thrombosis. Early recognition of thrombotic complications of CD and <br>initiation of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> is recommended to prevent hepatocyte injury <br>from venous congestion or fatal complications like development of PE. <br>(Figure Presented).<br><br>RECORD 48<br>Suppurative thrombophlebitis of the portal vein (pylephelbitis) - An ominous <br>complication of perforated appendicitis<br>Morley G.L. Dilworth M. Bowley D.M.<br>Colorectal Disease (2016) 18 Supplement 2 (69). Date of Publication: 1 Oct <br>2016<br><br>Background: Pylephelbitis is a rare consequence of infective intra-abdominal <br>pathology with high mortality. Case report: A 22 year old man was admitted <br>with a 10 day history of diarrhoea and vomiting. Examination revealed lower <br>abdominal tenderness and septic shock (HR 128, BP 98/57, temperature <br>40.1°C). In addition to raised inflammatory markers, admission blood tests <br>revealed raised bilirubin 107umol/l. An initial diagnosis of gastroenteritis <br>led to management of sepsis with resuscitation measures and ciprofloxacin. <br>Surgical advice was sought on day 3 and CT indicated perforated <br>appendicitis, plus <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> with air in the superior <br>mesenteric vein. Laparoscopic appendicectomy was undertaken, broad spectrum <br>antibiotics and therapeutic enoxaparin (1.5 mg/kg) were administered. The <br>patient recovered after a stormy course and remained on IV antibiotics for 6 <br>weeks and warfarin for over 3 months. Discussion: Pylephelbitis develops <br>when local sepsis creates a hyper-coagulable state with bacterial <br>infiltration of vessels. Localised small vein thrombophlebitis drains to <br>larger veins allowing extension of the septic inflammation into the superior <br>mesenteric vein and portal vein. Mortality from pylephlebitis remains high, <br>despite advances in imaging technology. The mainstay of treatment for <br>pylephlebitis is broad spectrum antibiotics and controlling the source of <br>infection; the use of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> is contentious. Conclusions: <br>Pylephelbitis is a rare and deadly complication. In the absence of primary <br>hepato-biliary disease, deranged liver function should raise suspicions and <br>CT imaging is central to the diagnosis. Resuscitation, broad spectrum <br>antibiotics and prompt source control are vital to achieve satisfactory <br>outcomes.<br><br>RECORD 49<br>A rare cause of liver failure<br>Jiang A.

Caucasian male <br>presented with right upper quadrant abdominal pain of 3 week duration, <br>associated with excessive fatigue, and progressive jaundice of his eyes and <br>skin. He did not have any past history of alcoholism or hepatitis. He did <br>have a history of polycythemia vera and atrial fibrillation with <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> on apixaban. On admission he was found to have AST 401 U/L, <br>ALT 197 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase 903 U/L, albumin of 3.2 gm/dL and <br>total bilirubin of 12.6 mg/dL, of which direct bilirubin was 8.9 mg/dL and <br>indirect bilirubin was 3.7 gm/dL, as well as an international normalized <br>ratio of 1.3. His Hepatitis A, B, and C, as well as EBV and CMV serologies <br>were negative. Anti-mitochondrial antibodies, ceruloplasmin, <br>alpha-1-antitrypsin, anti-neutrophil antibody, antismooth muscle antibody <br>were all within normal limits. His LDH was elevated at 542 U/L though AFP <br>and CEA were normal. His ferritin was also elevated at 554 ng/mL. A <br>non-obstructing <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> was seen on duplex ultrasound despite <br>the patient being on apixaban. Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen <br>showed hepatomegaly with a macronodular appearance and multiple T2 <br>hyperintensities in the hepatic parenchyma. A live biopsy was obtained with <br>the specimen showing Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma. Positron emission <br>tomography scan did not show any lymph node, spleen or other organ <br>involvement.

Date of <br>Publication: 1 Oct 2016<br><br>Introduction: Isolated small intestinal varices are an uncommon <br>manifestation of portal hypertension. Although uncommon, small intestinal <br>variceal hemorrhage can be life-threatening. We report a case of isolated <br>small bowel variceal hemorrhage in a man with previously undiagnosed <br>cirrhosis. Case: An 82 year-old man presenting with 5 weeks of melena and <br>anemia (hemoglobin 5.7 g/dL) was admitted to the hospital. Two months prior, <br>he had undergone coronary artery bypass graft surgery. His post-operative <br>course was complicated by new-onset atrial fibrillation; he was started on <br>therapeutic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> with apixaban. His past medical history was <br>otherwise notable for a history of chronic kidney disease secondary to <br>hypertension requiring kidney transplant fourteen years prior. Inpatient EGD <br>was normal. Colonoscopy with examination of ileum was normal except for <br>colonic diverticulosis without active or stigmata of recent bleeding. A CT <br>of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast revealed no abnormalities of the <br>liver or spleen. The patient was instructed to stop apixaban and was <br>discharged with stable hemoglobin level of 8.0 g/dL and platelet count <br>158,000. He had no further episodes of melena while inpatient. An outpatient <br>capsule endoscopy revealed the presence of blue tinged nodules in the distal <br>jejunum. Double balloon enteroscopy confirmed the presence of jejunal <br>varices without evidence of active bleeding or other high-risk stigmata <br>(Figure 1). The patient underwent liver ultrasound, which showed liver <br>contour nodularity and mildly enlarged splenic vein and spleen. There was <br>normal flow through hepatic and portal veins and hepatic arteries. <br>Discussion: We present a case of small intestinal varices in a patient with <br>no previous diagnosis or manifestations of portal hypertension. Small <br>intestinal varices are uncommon and are rarely reported to cause <br>gastrointestinal hemorrhage, but can cause significant blood loss when <br>hemorrhage does occur. Small intestinal variceal bleeding can present subtly <br>with occult gastrointestinal hemorrhage or dramatically with hypovolemic <br>shock, hematochezia and/or hematemesis. Small intestinal varices are most <br>often caused by portal hypertension in the setting of <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> or <br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>, but have also been associated with adhesions from <br>previous abdominal surgeries or other vascular anomalies. Prompt <br>identification and treatment, if necessary, are essential in the management <br>of small intestinal varices.

Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2016<br><br>Introduction: The liver plays a central role in the hemostatic system. The <br>coagulation system in patients with cirrhosis is in a state of rebalance <br>between antihemostatic and prohemostatic factors. The observation of <br>inherited thrombophilia (protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency, <br>antithrombin III deficiency, mutation of factor V Leiden, gene mutation of <br>prothrombin G20210A, polymorphism of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase <br>(MTHFR) C677T and A1298C, and polymorphism of angiotensin converting enzyme <br>(ACE-1) increase the risk of thrombosis of the portal vein in patients with <br>cirrhosis. It is suggested that hypercoagulability may play a role in <br>thrombosis of the hepatic artery after liver transplantation. Objective: To <br>characterize the profile of thrombophilia of pediatric patients with <br>cirrhosis and liver failure at the Hospital of Pediatrics, Western National <br>Medical Center. Material and Methods: A study was conducted in pediatric <br>patients, carriers of cirrhosis and liver failure at the Hospital of <br>Pediatrics. Anticoagulant activity protein (protein C, protein S and <br>antithrombin III) and factor VIII were determined by clotting assay. <br>Mutations of thrombophilia panel, including factor V Leiden mutation, <br>prothrombin gene mutation G20210AA, MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms, <br>and polymorphism of angiotensin converting enzyme ACE-1 were determined by <br>the technique of polymerase chain reaction. Results: There were 25 children, <br>13 males, 12 females. The average age was 50.76 ± 46.96 (4-189) months. The <br>main cause of cirrhosis was biliary tract atresia (72%). Distribution based <br>on the Child-Pugh stadium was the following: stage A 24%, stage B 48%, and <br>stage C 28%. It was identified protein C deficiency in 14 patients (56%), <br>protein S deficiency in 3 patients (12%), antithrombin III deficiency in 9 <br>patients (36%). Factor VIII elevated in 92% of the population was <br>documented. The mutations were made only to 23 patients; the main identified <br>mutation was polymorphism deletion ACE-1 in 8 patients (34.7%), the MTHFR <br>C677T polymorphism was the second cause with 21.7%, MTHFR A1298C <br>polymorphism in 8.6%, compound heterozygote of MTHFR C677T/A1298C in 17.3%. <br>Conclusions: It is considered that the deficiency of anticoagulant proteins <br>and elevation of factor VIII is acquired secondary to chronic liver disease <br>itself. The highest frequency of submission of ACE-1 may be due to the <br>association of ACE-1 in metabolic processes of the liver and liver <br>fibrogenesis participation.<br><br>RECORD 52<br>Coagulation parameters in patients with cirrhosis and <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> <br>treated sequentially with low molecular weight heparin and vitamin K <br>antagonists<br>Tripodi A.

Date of Publication: 1 <br>Oct 2016<br><br>Background/aims Information on coagulation for cirrhotics on anticoagulants <br>is scanty. We investigated plasma from 23 cirrhotics treated with <br>low-molecular-weight-heparin (LMWH) followed by vitamin K antagonists (VKA). <br>Methods On days 1–4 patients received full-dose LMWH. On day-5 VKA was <br>started and LMWH was terminated when INR therapeutic-interval was reached. <br>Blood was collected at peak and trough during LMWH, LMWH + VKA and VKA. <br>Non-cirrhotics on VKA were included as controls. Results Anti-factor Xa <br>increased from baseline-to-peak during LMWH. During LMWH + VKA was high and <br>reverted to zero during VKA. INR was slightly high at baseline, trough or <br>peak during LMWH and increased to 2.2 during LMWH + VKA or VKA. Mean VKA <br>weekly-doses for cirrhotics and controls were 28.5 mg and 28.6 mg. Protein C <br>decreased upon VKA, but not to the expected extent. <br>Endogenous-thrombin-potential (ETP) decreased from baseline (1436 nM min) to <br>trough (1258 nM min) and peak (700 nM min) during LMWH and was further <br>reduced during LMWH + VKA (395 nM min). Conclusions Target-INR for <br>cirrhotics can be reached by VKA dosages similar to those for <br>non-cirrhotics. ETP reduction parallels the effect of LMWH and/or VKA. <br>Whether these parameters represent the antithrombotic action elicited by <br>these drugs remains to be determined by clinical-trials and <br>laboratory-measurements. ETP, being a global-test reflecting both pro- and <br>anti-coagulants targeted by antithrombotic drugs, seems the candidate for <br>these trials.<br><br>RECORD 53<br>Pylephlebitis: Infective suppurative thrombosis of the portal vein<br>Houston J. Hazratjee N. Agrawal S.<br>American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016) 111 Supplement 1 (S901). Date of <br>Publication: 1 Oct 2016<br><br>Introduction: Pylephlebitis, also known as infective suppurative thrombosis <br>of the portal vein, is a serious condition with a high early mortality and <br>morbidity. It occurs when there is a combination of bacteremia and <br>thrombosis of the portal vein. We present a 60 year old male that had been <br>having flu like symptoms for the past month. Case Description: 60 year old <br>male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus was admitted for gram <br>positive cocci bacteremia found on blood cultures in the clinic. Blood <br>cultures were obtained as part of an evaluation for flu like symptoms of one <br>month's duration. On arrival to the hospital, a CT scan of his abdomen <br>revealed a thrombus in the right portal vein with impeded the portal venous <br>return. There were also two hypodense lesions on the posterior segment of <br>the right lobe of the liver that were thought to be abscesses. He was <br>admitted and started on IV Vancomycin and Zosyn as well as <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>with Coumadin. Blood cultures ended up growing B. fragilis and Strep <br>viridans and his antibiotic therapy was switched to Unasyn. On discharge he <br>was prescribed a course of Levaquin and Flagyl. On CT follow-up 1 month <br>later the he was found to have resolution of his thrombus and no signs of <br>the abscesses. Discussion: Any infection that occurs in the region of the <br>body that is drained by the portal venous system can lead to pylephlebitis <br>with diverticulitis being the most common. It has also been associated with <br>contiguous infections such as choledocholithiasis, pancreatitis, <br>intra-abdominal abscess and inflammatory bowel disease. The most common <br>bacteria to be found are Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli and <br>Streptococcus spp but the bacteremia is commonly polymicrobial. Diagnosis <br>can be made by abdominal ultrasound or CT scan of the abdomen showing a <br>thrombus in the portal vein. Empiric antibiotics are the treatment of choice <br>for pylephlebitis and should be based off of the suspected source of <br>infection. Successful antibiotic regimens include ampicillin, <br>fluoroquinolones, 3rd generation cephalosporins, metronidazole, clindamycin <br>and gentamicin. Antibiotics should be given parenterally until there is a <br>significant clinical improvement, and duration should be four to six weeks <br>in total. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy should also be considered, as <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy with antibiotics has a better outcome than <br>antibiotics alone.

Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2016<br><br>Background: Postoperative portomesenteric venous thrombosis (PMVT) is a rare <br>but potentially serious complication of gastric surgery. This study analyzed <br>the incidence, characteristics, risk factors, and outcomes of PMVT following <br>gastric surgery. Methods: Medical records of patients who underwent gastric <br>surgery between January 2007 and December 2012 were reviewed <br>retrospectively. The risk factors of PMVT were analyzed by a logistic <br>regression analysis with control group matched 1:4 by age, sex, and cancer <br>stage and by a Poisson regression analysis with unmatched control group. The <br>resolution rate of PMVT in 12 months was compared between the treatment <br>group and the nontreatment group. Results: The total incidence of PMVT after <br>gastric surgery was 0.67 % (31/4611). Most (54.84 %) PMVT cases were <br>detected within 1 month postoperatively. No accompanying deep vein <br>thrombosis (DVT) was noted. Multivariate comparison with 1:4 matched control <br>showed that combined splenectomy, synchronous malignancy, and <br>intra-abdominal complication were independent risk factors. Advanced stage, <br>combined splenectomy, and synchronous malignancy were independent risk <br>factors in Poisson regression analysis using unmatched controls. The <br>resolution rate of PMVT was not different from patients treated with <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> (n = 6) or antiplatelet therapy (n = 1) and were not <br>significantly different with those of the untreated group [85.7 % (6/7) vs. <br>82.3 % (14/17), p = 0.935] during 1-year follow up. Conclusions: PMVT after <br>gastric surgery was associated with advanced cancer stage, combined <br>splenectomy, and synchronous malignancy, but it was not related to <br>laparoscopy or DVT.

Date of <br>Publication: 1 Oct 2016<br><br>Introduction: Venous thromboembolic event (VTE) are frequently associated <br>with malignancy and leads to increased mortality. Hepatocellular carcinoma <br>(HCC) is often associated with concurrent cirrhosis which derange <br>coagulation-<span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> balance, leads to higher risk of VTE. This study <br>aim to characterize VTE in HCC, identify independent risk factors and assess <br>effects of VTE on overall prognosis in HCC. Methods: We retrospectively <br>analyzed patients with diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (by ICD-9 code) <br>at a large public hospital during 10 years (05/2006 through 05/2015). HCC <br>was confirmed by characteristic radiologic features and/or histology from <br>liver biopsy. VTE was further categorized into pulmonary embolism, <br>peripheral deep vein thrombosis, and intra-abdominal thrombosis. We exclude <br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> as tumor thrombus from direct invasion could be <br>confounded with bland thrombus. We collected data of patient-related risk <br>factors, tumor characters, laboratory at diagnosis, treatment- related risk <br>factors. We constructed multivariable logistic regression model through <br>STATA V.13. Results: 270 patients with complete dataset were included. <br>Thromboembolism events were identified in 16(5.9%) patients at an average of <br>6.2 months since diagnosis of HCC: 7(43.8%) pulmonary embolism, 4(25%) <br>peripheral deep vein thrombosis, 6(37.5%) intra-abdominal thrombosis. VTE <br>frequency by etiology of HCC: viral-HCC 2.60% (2/77), alcoholic-HCC 2.5% <br>(1/40), viral-alcoholic-HCC 9.17% (11/120), nonviral-nonalcoholic-HCC 6.06% <br>(2/33). VTE frequency by severity of cirrhosis: non-cirrhotic liver 4.88% (2 <br>cases of 41), Child A 1.03% (1 cases of 97), Child B 11.11% (10 cases of <br>90), Child C 6.8% (3 cases of 44). Multivariable regression showed <br>independent risk factors for VTE in HCC include: viralalcoholic- HCC (OR <br>18.7, p=0.017; CI 1.69-207.3), age (OR 2.86, p=0.017; CI 1.21 -6.78), <br>presence of extrahepatic metastasis (OR 7.27, p=0.025; CI 1.29-41.1), BMI <br>(OR 1.15, p=0.020; CI 1.02-1.29). VTE is not an independent risk factor for <br>preclusion from curative treatment, hospice or mortality. Conclusion: VTE <br>occurs in approximately 5.9% of patients with HCC. Patients with <br>viral-alcoholic HCC, elderly patients, patients with higher BMI or <br>extrahepatic metastasis are at higher risk of developing VTE; cirrhosis <br>severity by child score is not independent risk factor. VTE does not affect <br>overall prognosis after HCC diagnosis.<br><br>RECORD 56<br>Lemierre's syndrome wears a new outfit: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> associated <br>with fusobacterium nucleatum liver abscess<br>Khoudari G. Audi A. Alshoubaki N. Raheel K. Kothari T. El-Daher N. Matos <br>M.M.<br>American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016) 111 Supplement 1 (S1358). Date <br>of Publication: 1 Oct 2016<br><br>Majority of pyogenic liver abscesses (PLA) are caused by polymycrobial <br>infections, PLA secondary to Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) has <br>rarely been reported. We are describing a case of F. nucleatum liver abscess <br>complicated with <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>). A 60 year-old male presented <br>with right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, fever, and chills for 2 months. <br>Physical exam revealed hepatomegaly and RUQ tenderness. Laboratory data <br>showed WBC 21.8 /μl, Lactic acid 24 mg/dL, ALT 75 u/l, AST 39 u/l, ALP 412 <br>u/l, and total bilirubin 2.2 mg/dL. Abdominal US revealed large liver <br>lesions with decreased echogenicity. CT abdomen confirmed the large <br>hypodense lesions in the liver (10.2 x 6.7 cm), along with colonic wall <br>thickening and evidence of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. This raised suspicion for metastatic <br>disease, so colonoscopy was done and revealed diverticular disease, but no <br>diverticulitis. Subsequently, US guided liver aspiration and biopsy revealed <br>purulent material and cultures grew F. nucleatum. He was started on <br>intravenous Piperacillin/Tazobactam and Metronidazole along with Enoxaparin. <br>Liver abscesses were drained which led to significant clinical improvement. <br>Interval CT Scan 2 and 4 weeks after drainage showed near complete <br>resolution of the abscesses and <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Liver is the most common site of <br>visceral abscesses, likely due to its rich blood supply from the portal and <br>systemic circulations. PLAs are often secondary to polymicrobial pathogens, <br>however, mono microbial infections such as Escherichia coli, followed by <br>Klebsiella pneumoniae, are still possible. F. nucleatum is a gram negative <br>anaerobic bacterium which is considered normal flora of the oral cavity. <br>Recent evidence indicated that it is also a normal resident of <br>gastrointestinal tract. This pathogen has been rarely reported to cause PLA, <br>typically in immunocompromised patients with periodontal infections. <br>Fusobacterium is well know to cause pharyngitis with internal jugular venous <br>thrombosis in Lemierre's syndrome. To our knowledge, this case is one of few <br>cases linking F. nucleatum to PLA and <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in an immunocompetent patient <br>without identified periodontal or gastrointestinal infection. Early drainage <br>and proper antibiotic are the definitive treatments that have shown to <br>significantly reduce mortality. The role of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy for <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>remains controversial. In conclusion, this case demonstrates F. nucleatum as <br>a rare cause of liver abscess and highlights its ability to cause <span style="color: red">PVT</span>.<br><br>RECORD 57<br>Neonatal Hemostatic Disorders: Issues and Challenges<br>Hanmod S.S.

Date of Publication: <br>1 Oct 2016<br><br>ntroduction: Prehepatic portal hypertension (PH) in the absence of cirrhosis <br>and solid tumours is most commonly caused by thrombosis of the portal vein <br>(PT). Thrombosis in the portal system manifests as either acute abdominal <br>pain or occurs silently, and varices develop in response to increased portal <br>blood pressure. In 2016, the European Association forthe Study of the Liver <br>issued a new clinical practical guideline for the treatment of PT. To treat <br>acute PT, it is advised that <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy is initiated <br>immediately. It is recommended to treat patients with chronic PT by the same <br>way as patients with PH caused by <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span>. Aim: The aim of this <br>study was to describe a group of patients with portal thrombosis at the <br>University Hospital in Hradec Kralove (FNHK) and to compare the therapeutic <br>approaches used with those of the new guidelines. Method: Retrospective <br>description of all patients treated forthe above-mentioned portal thrombosis <br>in the FNHK that were identified in electronic records. Results: The cohort <br>consisted of 52 patients (27 males and 25 females); 44 patients with chronic <br>PT, six with acute PT, and two with subacute PT. All patients with acute or <br>subacute PT had been receiving anticoagulant therapy. Up to that point, five <br>patients had undergone transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), <br>four of whom had local thrombolysis. Patients with chronic PT were treated <br>the same as patients with PH and <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span>. Up to that point, six <br>spleno-renal shunt procedures, nine splenectomy procedures, seven <br>azygo-portal disconnection procedures, four TIPS procedures, one <br>mesentero-caval shunt procedure, and one splenic embolization procedure had <br>been performed.

Date of Publication: 1 <br>Sep 2016<br><br>Introduction: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) may occur in non-cirrhotic and <br>cirrhotic patients. It can be classified as acute (if a recent thrombus is <br>present) and chronic (if portal cavernoma has developed). Patients can be <br>symptomatic or may present signs and symptoms related to the development of <br>portal hypertension. In rare cases bowel infarction may occur. Areas <br>covered: This review provides an overview of the clinical presentation, <br>complications, diagnostic challenges and available treatments for <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in <br>non-cirrhotic and cirrhotic patients (NC<span style="color: red">PVT</span>). Expert opinion: Treatment of <br>acute NC<span style="color: red">PVT</span> aims at recanalizing the thrombosed veins and preventing <br>intestinal infarction and portal hypertension. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> should be <br>started promptly and maintained for at least 6 months. Long-term <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> should be implemented in the presence of underlying <br>persistent thrombotic state. In chronic NC<span style="color: red">PVT</span>, treatment aims at managing <br>portal hypertension and portal cavernoma cholangiopathy and preventing new <br>thrombotic events. In this setting, the indication for <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>should be individualized. No formal recommendations can be given for <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in <br>cirrhosis, since there are no randomized controlled trials, prospective <br>studies, or ad hoc guidelines.

Hanson S. Punzalan R. Braun K. Gourlay D.<br>American Journal of Hematology (2016) 91:9 (E382). Date of Publication: 1 <br>Sep 2016<br><br>Background: Children who suffer from traumatic brain injury (TBI) are at <br>higher risk for developing venous thromboembolism (VTE) during their <br>hospitalization. Adult studies have demonstrated that early institution of <br>chemical prophylaxis protects against VTEs and has a low risk of expanding <br>intracranial hemorrhage. The risks and benefits of chemical prophylaxis in <br>pediatric TBI have not been defined, resulting in long delays or total <br>avoidance of chemical prophylaxis. We sought to describe a series of <br>patients with severe TBI who received <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> without bleeding <br>complications. Methods: Following IRB approval, a retrospective review of <br>prospectively collected data of all injured children less than 18 years old <br>admitted to Children's Hospital of Wisconsin Intensive Care Unit (ICU) from <br>8/2010 to 8/2015 was performed. Patients with severe TBI were defined by an <br>Abbreviated Injury Scale head ≥ 3 and Glasgow Coma Scale score <9 on <br>admission. VTE incidence among patients with TBI was examined. Patient <br>characteristics were compared between groups with vs. without VTE. Outcomes <br>assessed were VTE incidence (deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary <br>embolism (PE)) among severe TBI patients, use of mechanical (i.e., <br>sequential compression devices, SCDs) and chemical prophylaxis as well as <br>bleeding complications secondary to <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. Independent T-tests <br>(unequal variance) were used for numerical average data analysis and for <br>comparison of proportions (alpha=0.05). Results: In our review of 4075 <br>hospitalized injured children, we found 141(3.5%) patients with severe TBI. <br>Nine patients with severe TBI developed VTE (7 DVT, 1 PE, 1 portal vein <br>thrombosis) resulting in a 6.4% incidence among this cohort. Age, gender, <br>ventilation and ICU days were comparable between VTE and non-VTE cohorts. <br>Within the TBI cohort, 33% (3/9) of the patients were diagnosed by <br>ultrasound associated with symptoms of VTE at a median of 3 days (range <br>1-9), 44% (4/9) by screening ultrasound at a median of 7 days (range 6-13), <br>and two by computed tomography. Seven (78%) VTEs were CVL associated. Only <br>one child received chemical prophylaxis prior to VTE diagnosis (11.1%) due <br>to high bleeding risk, which compared to the 11.4% chemical prophylaxis in <br>the non-VTE group. Both VTE and non-VTE groups had similar compliance with <br>SCDs (44% vs. 39%, p=0.76). Six of the nine (67%) patients were <br>anticoagulated, either therapeutic or partial, immediately upon discovery of <br>the VTE, with a range of 6-19 days (mean 12.3, median 11) after admission. <br>Three patients did not receive <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> after diagnosed with VTE due <br>to ongoing concerns for bleeding. There were no bleeding complications <br>resulting from either prophylactic or treatment dose <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. <br>Conclusions: This series is among the first to describe the higher VTE <br>incidence among children with severe TBI. Thrombus formation likely occurs <br>prior to symptom development, suggesting earlier surveillance could result <br>more timely management of VTE. While this series demonstrated no clinically <br>significant bleeding in the patients receiving <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> after severe <br>TBI, additional prospective studies aimed at defining the safety of early <br>chemical prophylaxis should be pursued.<br><br>RECORD 61<br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in a Preterm Newborn with Mutation of the MTHFR and <br>PAI-1 Genes and Sepsis by Candida parapsilosis<br>Giuffrè M.

The present paper reports an alternative hypothesis suggesting a <br>central role of micro-vascular ischemia in fibrogenesis and cirrhosis <br>development, whatever is the aetiology of liver chronic injury. In fact, <br>since chronic liver injury could finally result in endothelial damage and <br>micro-vascular thrombosis, leading to a trigger of inappropriate hepatocyte <br>proliferation and fibrosis, finally cirrhosis development could arise from <br>chronic micro-vascular ischemia. Recently, some important confirmation of <br>this hypothesis has been reported. In fact, in a murine experimental model <br>of congestive hepatopathy, it was found that chronic hepatic congestion <br>leads to sinusoidal thrombosis and strain, which in turn promote hepatic <br>fibrosis. Furthermore, a study on a murine model of cirrhosis reported <br>enoxaparin to reduce hepatic vascular resistance and portal pressure by <br>having a protective role against fibrogenesis.In conclusion, the hypothesis <br>giving a central role of micro-vascular ischemia in fibrogenesis and <br>cirrhosis development could change the clinical scenario of chronic liver <br>disease and have several main implications on management of various liver <br>disease.<br><br>RECORD 63<br>First case with antithrombin deficiency, mesenteric vein thrombosis and <br>pregnancy: Multidisciplinary diagnosis and successful management<br>García-Botella A.

We sought to <br>characterize the presentation and management of patients with SVT at a large <br>tertiary hospital. A total of 43 patients’ electronic medical records were <br>reviewed. Median age at diagnosis was 43 (18–71). Sixteen patients had <br>isolated <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (37.2 %), and 16 (37.2 %) had thrombosis <br>involving multiple splanchnic veins. Abdominal pain was the most common <br>clinical presentation (67.4 %).

Aim To <br>report an update on the management of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Methods A review was performed on <br>the outcome, prevention, and treatment of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Results Some studies suggest <br>that <span style="color: red">PVT</span> could worsen the rate of hepatic decompensation and survival of <br>cirrhosis, whereas others report a non-negative impact of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in the outcome <br>of cirrhosis. Therefore, the prognostic value of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in cirrhosis remains a <br>gray zone. One single randomized-controlled trial reported that enoxaparin <br>could prevent <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, delay the occurrence of hepatic decompensation, and <br>improve survival. However, no further study data confirmed this assumption <br>and the issue is not actually generalizable. Numerous studies report that <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> determines a relatively high rate of portal vein <br>recanalization in cirrhotics <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. However, further data are warranted to <br>confirm the risk-to-benefit of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, especially bleeding. <br>Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) has been reported to be <br>effective as a treatment of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in cirrhosis, with the advantage of avoiding <br>the risk of bleeding linked to <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. However, there are no data <br>comparing TIPS with <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> as a treatment of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in cirrhosis. <br>Furthermore, there is no evidence on whether both <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> and TIPS <br>improve survival.

Further data are needed to weigh the risk/benefit ratio of <br>enoxaparin for the prevention of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in cirrhosis. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> or TIPS <br>should probably be indicated in liver transplantation candidates, but <br>avoided in patients not suitable for liver transplantation and with an <br>otherwise poor prognosis.

The objective of this study was to investigate the safety and <br>effectiveness of warfarin with a target international normalized ratio (INR) <br>of 2.0-2.5 for the prevention of PVST after LSD. Hitherto, this is the first <br>study to assess the use of warfarin in this field. Materials and Methods: We <br>retrospectively analyzed a database of 73 consecutive patients who underwent <br>LSD from January 2013 to September 2014. Patients were categorized into the <br>warfarin group (34 patients) and the aspirin group (39 patients). The INR <br>and incidence of PSVT were monitored for 90 days. Results: Compared with the <br>aspirin group, the warfarin group had a lower incidence of PVST on <br>postoperative day (POD) 30 [17/34 (50.0%) versus 29/39 (74.4%); P = .032] <br>and POD 90 [8/34 (23.5%) versus 30/39 (76.9%); P < .0001] and main portal <br>vein thrombosis (M<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) on POD 90 [3 (8.8%) versus 13 (33.3%); P = .012]. <br>From POD 30 to 90, the warfarin group achieved more complete recanalization <br>of PVST [9/17 (52.9%) versus 3/29 (10.3%), P = .005] and M<span style="color: red">PVT</span> [9/12 (75.0%) <br>versus 3/12 (25.0%), P = .039].

Nucleoside analogues and peginterferon plus ribavirin combination <br>therapy improve the prognosis of patients with hepatitis B virus related <br><span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> and hepatitis C related compensated <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span>, <br>respectively, although the latter therapy may be replaced by direct-acting <br>antivirals. For <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> caused by primary biliary cirrhosis and <br>active autoimmune hepatitis, urosodeoxycholic acid and steroid are <br>recommended, respectively. The most adequate modalities for the management <br>of variceal bleeding are the endoscopic injection sclerotherapy for <br>esophageal varices and the balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous <br>obliteration following endoscopic obturation with cyanoacrylate for gastric <br>varices. Beta-blockers are useful for primary prophylaxis of esophageal <br>variceal bleeding. The V(2) receptor antagonist tolvaptan is a useful add-on <br>therapy in careful diuretic therapy for ascites. Albumin infusion is useful <br>for the prevention of paracentesis-induced circulatory disturbance and renal <br>failure. In addition to disaccharides, the nonabsorbable antibiotic <br>rifaximin is useful for the management of encephalopathy. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>therapy is proposed for patients with acute-onset or progressive portal vein <br>thrombosis.<br><br>RECORD 70<br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in cirrhosis: Controversies and latest developments<br>Harding D.J.

Date of <br>Publication: 14 Jun 2016<br><br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is encountered in <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span>, particularly <br>in advanced disease. It has been a feared complication of cirrhosis, <br>attributed to significant worsening of liver disease, poorer clinical <br>outcomes and potential inoperability at liver transplantation; also <br>catastrophic events such as acute intestinal ischaemia. Optimal management <br>of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> has not yet been addressed in any consensus publication. We review <br>current literature on <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in cirrhosis; its prevalence, pathophysiology, <br>diagnosis, impact on the natural history of cirrhosis and liver <br>transplantation, and management. Studies were identified by a search <br>strategy using MEDLINE and Google Scholar. The incidence of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> increases <br>with increasing severity of liver disease: less than 1% in well-compensated <br>cirrhosis, 7.4%-16% in advanced cirrhosis.

Lim H.Y. Chua C.C. Sleeman M. Tacey M. Donnan G. Nandurkar H.<br>Thrombosis Research (2016) 142 (11-16). Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2016<br><br>Introduction Isolated distal deep venous thrombosis (IDDVT) is traditionally <br>associated with less severe clinical sequelae, with ongoing debate on <br>multiple aspects of its management. Despite numerous studies evaluating its <br>acute management, there remains a paucity of data evaluating long-term <br>complications such as recurrence and subsequent malignancy. We aim to <br>evaluate the characteristics of IDDVT in institutions that routinely perform <br>whole leg ultrasonography, and the risks of recurrence and complications in <br>comparison to major venous thromboembolism (major VTE; defined as above-knee <br>or proximal DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE)). Methods Retrospective <br>evaluation of consecutive IDDVT and major VTE from July 2011 to December <br>2012 in a hospital network in Melbourne, Australia. Patients were followed <br>up for a minimum of 24 months. Patients with active malignancy were <br>excluded. Results Of 1024 VTE cases, there were 164 non-cancer patients (92 <br>males, 72 females, median age of 61 years) with IDDVT. Compared to major <br>VTE, IDDVT was more likely to be provoked (73% vs 59%, p < 0.01), has <br>shorter duration of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> (median 3.5 months vs 6.0 months, p < <br>0.01) and less clinically significant bleeding (2.4% vs 6.7%, p = 0.05), <br>independent of duration of therapy. Recurrence was non-inferior compared to <br>major VTE (10% vs 7%, p = 0.36) and 60% recurred with major VTE. Three <br>(1.8%) were subsequently diagnosed with cancer (vs 1.9% in major VTE, p = <br>0.97). Conclusions IDDVT has non-inferior rates of recurrence and subsequent <br>cancer detection compared to major VTE and hence, its clinical significance <br>should not differ from major VTE. Further studies are required to determine <br>the adequate length of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>.<br><br>RECORD 72<br>Incidental splanchnic vein thrombosis: preliminary registry data<br>Ames P.R.J.

Date of Publication: 1 <br>Jun 2016<br><br>Introduction: Portal vein system thrombosis (PVST) is an alarming and <br>potentially life-threatening complication of laparoscopic splenectomy and <br>azygoportal disconnection (LSD). The objective of this study was to <br>investigate negative and positive predictors of PVST after LSD in patients <br>receiving anticoagulant regimens with aspirin or warfarin. Methods: <br>Seventy-five consecutive patients who underwent LSD from 2013 to 2014 were <br>retrospectively reviewed. Patients received anticoagulant regimen with <br>warfarin (n = 35) or aspirin (n = 40) according to individual preference. <br>International normalized ratio (INR) and the incidence of PSVT were compared <br>in patients received anticoagulant regimen with warfarin or aspirin on <br>postoperative days (POD) 7, 30, and 90, and factors associated with PVST at <br>these time points were determined by univariate and logistic multivariable <br>regression analyses. Results: Portal vein diameter was an independent <br>negative predictor of PVST on PODs 7, 30, and 90. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> with <br>warfarin was an independent positive predictor of PVST on PODs 30 and 90, <br>and INR was an independent positive predictor of PVST on POD 90. Dynamic <br>changes in the incidence of PVST on the day of admission and on PODs 7, 30, <br>and 90 differed significantly between the warfarin and aspirin groups (P = <br>0.002). No patient experienced perioperative bleeding. Conclusions: Portal <br>vein diameter was an independent negative predictor, while <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>therapy with warfarin and INR were independent positive predictors, of PVST <br>after LSD. Early <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> with warfarin is safe and effective for the <br>prevention of PVST after LSD.<br><br>RECORD 74<br>Risk factors of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in acute pancreatitis<br>Chooklin S. Pidhirnyy B. Osmilovska I. Usach O.<br>Pancreatology (2016) 16:3 SUPPL. 1 (S91-S92). Date of Publication: June 2016<br><br>Introduction: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is a one local complication of <br>acute pancreatitis. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> does not cause any additional symptom in most cases <br>and is usually detected incidentally on ultrasonography and computed <br>tomography performed to evaluate the severity of pancreatitis. Aims: The aim <br>of this study was to investigate to determine the risk factors of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in <br>severe acute pancreatitis. Patients & methods: 276 patients with severe <br>acute pancreatitis were studied. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was identified in 15 patients. <br>Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were applied to explore <br>potential risk factors for the development of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in acute necrotizing <br>pancreatitis patients. Mortality, organ failure and length of hospital stay <br>were also compared between patients with or without <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Results: Leukocytes <br>(>10 × 10(9)/L), hyperglycemia (≥ 10 mmol/L), alcoholic etiology high <br>intra-abdominal pressure, infected pancreatic necrosis were risk factors for <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> showed higher mortality, longer hospital duration, <br>higher rates of a variety of complications and more utilization of invasive <br>interventions. Conclusion: We identified the risk factors of portal vein <br>thrombosis in severe acute pancreatitis. In these cases the physicians <br>should consider therapeutic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> to prevent <span style="color: red">PVT</span>.<br><br>RECORD 75<br>Outcomes of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> use for <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in University of <br>Wisconsin liver transplant patients<br>Falls M. Said A. Fernandez L. Foley D. Frith K. Hager D. Hoy H. Leverson G. <br>Mezrich J. Prickette T. Wakefield M. D'Alessandro A.<br>American Journal of Transplantation (2016) 16 Supplement 3 (673-674). Date <br>of Publication: 1 Jun 2016<br><br>Background: The prevalence of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) in cirrhotic <br>liver transplant patients increases the risk of morbidity and mortality <br>post-liver transplantation. Current research suggests that <span style="color: red">PVT</span> should be <br>managed with <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in those with cirrhosis that are waiting for <br>liver transplant. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy and management is not uniformly <br>practiced in pre-liver transplant patients with cirrhosis and <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, nor are <br>there established clinical guidelines. The purpose of this study was to <br>compare the outcomes in mortality following liver transplant in patients <br>from the University of Wisconsin who had <span style="color: red">PVT</span> prior to transplantation and <br>were, or were not treated with <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. Methods: This was a <br>single-institution, retrospective review from a prospectively collected <br>database to evaluate the utility of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy in patients with <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span> that underwent liver transplantation between January 1, 2006 and June <br>30, 2014. The primary outcome of interest was patient mortality. Patients <br>were excluded as a result of additional diagnoses including atrial <br>fibrillation, cerebral vascular accident, pulmonary emboli and deep vein <br>thrombosis. Results: From a total of 755 liver transplants performed between <br>January 1, 2006 and June 30, 2014, 56 patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> were evaluated in <br>this study(Table 1). There was no statistically significant difference in <br>mortality between the 4 groups in table 1 (p = 0.67). Conclusion: This study <br>suggests the use of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> and thrombectomy at liver transplant may <br>improve the mortality outcomes in this population (Table 1). The results are <br>not statistically significant, likely due to the small sample size. A <br>multi-center study of the same design would be of benefit to improve the <br>power of the data and better evaluate the use of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy in <br>the liver transplant patient with <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Review of this data in 2 years would <br>allow us to continue to further evaluate morbidity and mortality in this <br>patient cohort.

Date of Publication: 1 Jun <br>2016<br><br>Background Little information is available about the clinical history of <br>patients with incidentally detected splanchnic vein thrombosis and its <br>therapeutic management remains controversial. The aim of this study was to <br>assess the risk factors, therapeutic strategies, and long-term outcomes of <br>incidentally detected splanchnic vein thrombosis. Methods We analysed data <br>from patients with incidentally detected splanchnic vein thrombosis who were <br>enrolled in an international, multicentre, prospective cohort study of <br>splanchnic vein thrombosis between 2008 and 2012. The study was done at 31 <br>centres in 11 countries (Italy, South Korea, Germany, Canada, Belgium, the <br>Netherlands, Brazil, USA, France, Israel, UK). Information about demographic <br>characteristics, risk factors, and treatment was collected. The study <br>outcomes during the 2-year follow-up were major bleeding (International <br>Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis definition plus the need for hospital <br>admission), thrombotic events (venous or arterial thromboses), and <br>mortality. The primary analysis period was from the diagnosis of <br>incidentally detected splanchnic vein thrombosis until the first adjudicated <br>clinical outcome or the end of follow-up. Findings Between May 2, 2008, and <br>Jan 30, 2012, we enrolled 177 patients with incidentally detected splanchnic <br>vein thrombosis (median age 57 years [IQR 49–66], 118 [67%] men, 138 [78%] <br>patients with <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>). The most common underlying diseases <br>were <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> (82 [46%] patients) and solid cancer (62 [35%] <br>patients). Anticoagulant treatment was prescribed to 109 (62%) patients. <br>Median duration of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was 6 months (IQR 5–12) for patients who <br>received parenteral anticoagulants alone and 24 months (IQR 12–24) for <br>patients treated with vitamin K antagonists. During a median follow-up of 2 <br>years (IQR 1–2), the incidence of major bleeding was 3·3 events (95% CI <br>1·7–6·3) per 100 patient-years and the incidence of thrombotic events was <br>8·0 events (95% CI 5·2–12·1) per 100 patient-years. On-treatment incidence <br>was 3·2 events (95% CI 1·2–8·4) per 100 patient-years for major bleeding and <br>3·9 events (95% CI 1·6–9·5) per 100 patient-years for thrombotic events. In <br>multivariate analysis, anticoagulant treatment as a time-dependent variable <br>reduced the incidence of thrombotic events (hazard ratio 0·85, 95% CI <br>0·76–0·96) without increasing the risk of major bleeding (p>0·05). In <br>patients with clinically suspected splanchnic vein thrombosis, the incidence <br>of major bleeding was 3·9 events (95% CI 2·6–5·7) per 100 patient-years and <br>the incidence of thrombotic events was 7·0 events (95% CI 5·2–9·3) per 100 <br>patient-years. Interpretation Our results show that the prognosis of <br>incidentally detected splanchnic vein thrombosis is similar to that of <br>clinically suspected splanchnic vein thrombosis and suggest that similar <br>treatment strategies should be applied.

Abdelsamee M.A. Kamel Y.<br>Annals of Medicine and Surgery (2016) 8 (28-39). Date of Publication: 1 Jun <br>2016<br><br>Objectives: Hepatic arterial (HA) and portal venous (PV) complications of <br>recipients after living donor liver transplantation(LDLT) result in patient <br>loss. The aim of this study was to analyze these complications. Methods: We <br>retrospectively analyzed HA and/or PV complications in 213 of 222 recipients <br>underwent LDLT in our centre. The overall male/female and adult/pediatric <br>ratios were 183/30 and 186/27 respectively. Results: The overall incidence <br>of HA and/or PV complications was 19.7% (n = 42), while adult and pediatric <br>complications were 18.3% (n = 39) and 1.4% (n = 3) respectively. However <br>early (<1month) and late (>1month) complications were 9.4% (n = 20) and <br>10.3% (n = 22) respectively. Individually HA problems (HA stenosis, HA <br>thrombosis, injury and arterial steal syndrome) 15% (n = 32), PV problems <br>(PV thrombosis and PV stenosis) 2.8% (n = 6) and simultaneous HA and PV <br>problems 1.9% (n = 4). 40/42 of complications were managed by angiography (n <br>= 18), surgery (n = 10) or medically (Anticoagulant and/or thrombolytic) (n <br>= 12) where successful treatment occurred in 18 patients. 13/42 (31%) of <br>patients died as a direct result of these complications. Preoperative <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>was significant predictor of these complications in univariate analysis. The <br>6-month, 1-, 3-, 5- 7- and 10-year survival rates in patients were 65.3%, <br>61.5%, 55.9%, 55.4%, 54.5% and 54.5% respectively. Conclusion: HA and/or PV <br>complications specially early ones lead to significant poor outcome after <br>LDLT, so proper dealing with the risk factors like pre LT <span style="color: red">PVT</span> (I.e. More <br>intensive <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy) and the effective management of these <br>complications are mandatory for improving outcome.<br><br>RECORD 79<br>Is Post-TIPS <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> Therapy Necessary in Patients with Cirrhosis <br>and <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>? A Randomized Controlled Trial<br>Wang Z. Jiang M.-S. Zhang H.-L. Weng N.-N. Luo X.-F. Li X. Yang L.<br>Radiology (2016) 279:3 (943-951). Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2016<br><br>Purpose To determine whether posttransjugular intrahepatic portosystemic <br>shunt (TIPS) placement <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy could benefit patients with <br>cirrhosis and <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) from the perspective of a change <br>in portal vein patency status and clinical outcomes. Materials and Methods <br>The study was approved by the institutional review board, and informed <br>consent was obtained from each patient. From October 2012 to February 2014, <br>patients with cirrhosis and <span style="color: red">PVT</span> who underwent TIPS placement were randomly <br>assigned to the <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy or control group. All patients were <br>followed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the TIPS procedure. Outcome <br>measures were a change of portal vein patency status and clinical measures <br>including gastrointestinal rebleeding, shunt dysfunction, hepatic <br>encephalopathy, and survival. Student t test, χ(2) test, Fisher exact test, <br>Mann-Whitney U test, and logistical regression were applied where <br>appropriate. Results A total of 64 patients were enrolled in the study, with <br>31 allocated to the <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> group and 33 allocated to the control <br>group. Overall, thrombi were improved in 61 patients (96.8%) after the <br>procedure. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> recanalization (ie, complete disappearance; reconstruction of <br>cavernous transformation) was achieved in 26 patients (83.9%) in the <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy group and in 23 (71.8%) patients in tthe control <br>group (P = .252). The presence of a superior mesenteric vein thrombus may <br>help predict recanalization failure (unadjusted relative risk = 0.243; 95% <br>confidence interval: 0.070, 0.843; P = .026). Clinical outcomes were also <br>similar between the two groups. Conclusion <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy may not <br>be necessary in certain patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> because TIPS placement alone can <br>achieve a high persistent recanalization rate.

Henry Z.H. Maitland H. Shah N.L. Argo C.K. Northup P.G. <br>Caldwell S.H.<br>Digestive Diseases and Sciences (2016) 61:6 (1721-1727). Date of <br>Publication: 1 Jun 2016<br><br>Background and Aims: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) are important new <br>anticoagulant therapies that are not well studied in patients with chronic <br>liver disease. The aim of this study was to compare rates of bleeding in <br>cirrhosis patients treated with DOAC (factor Xa inhibitors: rivaroxaban and <br>apixaban) to those in cirrhosis patients treated with traditional <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> (warfarin and low molecular weight heparin). Methods: We <br>identified a total of 39 patients with cirrhosis who received <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy over a 3-year period (20 DOAC and 19 traditional <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>) from a research database. Medical records were reviewed to <br>obtain clinical data to compare between the groups. Results: Clinical <br>characteristics between the two groups were similar. There were three <br>documented bleeding events in the traditional <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> group and four <br>bleeding events in the DOAC group (p = 0.9). There were two major bleeding <br>events in the traditional <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> group and one major bleeding event <br>in the DOAC group. There were no documented reports of drug-induced liver <br>injury during this study period. Among all patients, no significant <br>predictors of bleeding were identified using univariate regression and Cox <br>proportional hazard modeling. Conclusions: This is the first clinical study <br>evaluating the use of DOAC in patients with cirrhosis. DOAC display similar <br>safety characteristics when compared to traditional <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in <br>patients with cirrhosis and are potentially attractive agents for <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy.

Kayal A. Carvalho R. Weiss A.<br>Canadian Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2016) 2016. Date of <br>Publication: 2016<br><br>Background. <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is a seen in about 20-44% of <br>patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To our knowledge, no other <br>study has looked at the need for <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in patients with HCC and <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Aims. The aim of this study is to investigate the natural history and <br>progression of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in patients with hepatocellular <br>carcinoma with or without <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy. Methods. Using the <br>British Columbia Cancer Agency database, a cohort of 54 patients who were <br>diagnosed with both conditions were evaluated retrospectively. Nine patients <br>were excluded secondary to lack of follow up. HCC and <span style="color: red">PVT</span> diagnosis and <br>followup was made with contrast enhanced CT or MRI. Most patients received a <br>single or a combination of the following treatments: transarterial <br>chemoembolization, radiofrequency ablation or surgical resection. Thirty <br>five (78%) patients received systemic therapy with Sorafenib. Results. <br>Thirty eight patients were males and mean age was 62.8. Liver disease <br>etiology was HCV in 19 (42%), HBV in 18 (40%), ETOH in 5 (11%) and <br>hemochromatosis in 1 (2%). Results: Average survival after HCC diagnosis was <br>28 months and 15 months after <span style="color: red">PVT</span> diagnosis. Among the 45 patients <br>evaluated, 8 patients received <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> while 39 did not. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>progression occurred in 19 (49%) of the non anticoagulated group, and 4 <br>(67%) of the anticoagulated group. Right portal vein involvement was seen in <br>18 (40%) patients with progression in 67% of the time, Left <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in 13 (28%) <br>with a progression in 7(54%), and main <span style="color: red">PVT</span> 6 (13%) with a progression in <br>(67%). In 1 case, <span style="color: red">PVT</span> progressed from the main <span style="color: red">PVT</span> to Superior mesenteric <br>vein (SMV) and from the LPV to SMV in 2 other cases. No symptoms directly <br>related to <span style="color: red">PVT</span> development were reported. Conclusions. The possible <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> related complications need to be considered before <br>attempting therapy in patients with HCC and <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Despite the small number of <br>patients included in this study, this review shows that <span style="color: red">PVT</span> progression in <br>patients with HCC and the absence of clinical complications is similar in <br>both anticoagulated and non anticoagulated groups. Thus, the usefulness of <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in this patient population needs to be further studied. <br>(Table presented).<br><br>RECORD 82<br>Length of anti-coagulation in splanchnic venous thrombosis<br>Hasan M. Rashid A. Moiz B. Sarwar S.<br>Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016) 14 SUPPL. 1 (34). Date of <br>Publication: May 2016<br><br>Background: <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy of SVT is a clinical challenge. Patients <br>are at risk of developing certain complications and may experience <br>recurrence. Anticoagulant therapy remains the cornerstone of treatment and <br>should be started as soon as possible to prevent recurrence. Many patients <br>are left untreated because the risks associated with anticoagulant therapy <br>are calculated to exceed its benefits. However, the majority of patients <br>receive <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> with heterogeneous timing of initiation, drugs, and <br>doses. Aims: To observe the length of anti-coagulation in splanchnic venous <br>thrombosis. Methods: Retrospective, observational study of case charts of <br>hospitalized patients diagnosed with SVT at Aga Khan Hospital Karachi during <br>January to June 2015. Patients suffering SVT were identified by using ICD 9 <br>coding. Details were obtained from electronic medical record system. <br>Results: SVT was found in 17 patients. Presenting compliant was abdominal <br>pain in 9 patients. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was not started in 8 patients because of <br>either risk of bleeding or chronic nature of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. 5 <br>patients were started on Enoxaparin 60 mg twice daily and Warfarin (5-10 mg <br>daily). Enoxaparin was stopped after achieving therapeutic INR and warfarin <br>was continued. 4 patients were started only on warfarin (5-10 mg daily). <br>Only 1 patient had bleeding due to warfarin after 20 days of initiation so <br>it was stopped and he received enoxaparin for around 12 months. Out of other <br>8 patients only one had unstable INR (i.e. time in therapeutic range< 60%). <br>Warfarin was continued for more than 4 months in these patients with median <br>time 5.3 months. No episode of recurrence was reported in any of these <br>patients till to date. Conclusions: <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was started in patients <br>having SVT immediately after the diagnosis with warfarin with or without <br>enoxaparin. Median length of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> with warfarin was 5.3 months. <br>This is an ongoing study so results may vary in final set of data.<br><br>RECORD 83<br>A rare pain in a common scenario<br>Seth A.

Date <br>of Publication: May 2016<br><br>LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1: Recognize pylephlebitis as a rare etiology of <br>abdominal pain LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2: Identify the indications for <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> CASE: A 62 year old Caucasian male with history of <br>hypertension and remote cholecystectomy presented with 1 week ofmalaise, <br>night sweats, fevers, and anorexia after consuming fast food. Three days <br>prior to admission, he developed non- bloody, non-bilious emesis and <br>non-radiating, cramping, epigastric pain not associated with meals. He <br>denied preceding weight loss, changes in stool frequency, color, or caliber, <br>dysuria, joint pains, or skin rashes. He had no recent sick contacts, <br>travel, or family history of malignancy. Upon arrival, vital signs <br>demonstrated temperature 101°Fahrenheit, blood pressure 74/53 mmHg, heart <br>rate 105 beats/min, and respiratory rate 18 breaths/min. The patient had <br>pallor, dry mucus membranes, diffuse abdominal tenderness with no rebound or <br>guarding, splenomegaly without hepatomegaly, and cool extremities. Pertinent <br>labs included leukocytosis of 14.2 K/ul, platelets 51 K/ul, creatinine 3.59 <br>mg/dL, bicarbonate 20 mmol/L, total bilirubin 6.9 mg/dL, direct bilirubin <br>5.3 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 562 U/L, alanine transaminase 128 U/L, <br>aspartate transaminase 152 U/L, venous lactate 46 mmol/L, and normal <br>coagulation factors. Blood cultures grew Escherichia coli and Klebsiella <br>pneumoniae. Abdominal computed tomography demonstrated a thrombus in the <br>portal vein confluence and adjacent superior mesenteric vein with small <br>bowel wall thickening. The presence of a thrombus prompted evaluation for <br>malignancy and hypercoagulability disorder, respectively. No malignancy was <br>found; however, he tested positive for antiphospholipid antibody syndrome <br>(APLS). Ultimately, he was diagnosed with pylephlebitis secondary to small <br>bowel enteritis and underlying APLS. Despite antibiotics and heparin, the <br>patient developed recurrent abdominal pain and fever requiring partial <br>resection of ischemic small bowel. DISCUSSION: Septic thrombophlebitis of <br>the portal vein, or pylephlebitis, is a rare clinical entity. In the past, <br>pylephlebitis was frequently associated with appendicitis; however, common <br>etiologies today are biliary infections, colonic infections and <br>hypercoagulable conditions. Symptoms are non-specific including fevers, <br>chills, malaise, and abdominal pain. Bacteremia often occurs, particularly <br>due to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Peptostreptococcus, and <br>Bacteroides fragilis. Splenomegaly in the absence of hepatomegaly or chronic <br>liver disease should prompt consideration of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. <br>Splenomegaly is present in 10-25 % of patients with pylephlebitis. The <br>cornerstone of treatment is antibiotics. Some patients may require surgical <br>intervention if complications of pylephlebitis occur, which include hepatic <br>abscess formation and small bowel ischemia. Patients with pylephlebitis <br>should be evaluated for underlying malignancy, hypercoagulability disorders, <br>inflammatory bowel disease, and human immunodeficiency virus. The <br>indications for <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> are controversial but include <br>hypercoagulable state (i.e. APLS), persistent fever despite antibiotics, and <br>thrombus involving the superior mesenteric vein due to risk of small bowel <br>ischemia. Internists should have a high index of suspicion for pylephlebitis <br>in patients presenting with abdominal pain and septic shock given the <br>potential morbidity and mortality associated with this under-recognized <br>condition. Additionally, physicians should consider the use of <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in patients with thrombus involving the superior mesenteric <br>vein as this can lead to small bowel ischemia, as was the case in our <br>patient. All cases of pylephlebitis should warrant work up for an underlying <br>hypercoagulable state.<br><br>RECORD 84<br>Our clinical experience in the evaluation of mesenteric vein thrombosis<br>Ilhan M. Bademler S. Azamat I.F. Baysal A. Kaan Gök A.F. Guloglu R. Kurtoglu <br>M.<br>Thrombosis Research (2016) 141 Supplement 1 (S43). Date of Publication: 1 <br>May 2016<br><br>Background: Mesenteric vein thrombosis occurs rarely and is responsible for <br>approximately 5-15% of all cases of acute mesenteric ischemia. The aim of <br>this report was to discuss the management of mesenteric vein thrombosis <br>based on our experience with 59 patients. Methods: In the present study, 59 <br>patients who were admitted to our emergency surgery department between <br>January 2010 and July 2015 with a diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischemia <br>were assessed retrospectively. Patients with peritoneal signs first <br>underwent diagnostic laparoscopy to rule out perforation or bowel necrosis. <br>All patients were administered 100 mg/kg of the anticoagulant enoxaparin <br>twice daily. Results: CT angiography revealed superior mesenteric vein <br>thrombosis in 14 (23%) patients, <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in 6 (10%) patients, <br>and splenic vein thrombosis in 2 (3%) patients. Four patients with <br>peritoneal signs underwent diagnostic laparoscopy; two of the patients <br>performed small bowel resection, anastomosis, and trocar insertion. In a <br>patient reactional fluid and edema was seen in 60 cm small intestine and <br>another patient 20 cm segmental edema seen and second look laparoscopy was <br>made. Conclusions: Early diagnosis with CT angiography, conservative <br>treatment with proper <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> and laparoscopic second look detecting <br>with supportive intensive care are the cornerstones of successful treatment <br>of mesenteric vein thrombosis.<br><br>RECORD 85<br>Re-exploration after liver transplant-does it affect outcomes?<br>Mehrotra S.

Date of Publication: 1 May <br>2016<br><br>Introduction Re-exploration after any surgical procedure is technically more <br>difficult and associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Few studies <br>have shown outcomes of re-exploration after liver transplant which is <br>expected to be worse than other surgical procedures Aim To assess the short <br>term and long term outcomes in patients undergoing reexploration after liver <br>transplant. Patients and Methods We analysed our prospectively collected <br>data from January 2011 to July 2015 for patients undergoing re-exploration <br>for various indications after liver transplant. Routine post-operative <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was not used in all the patients. The study group was <br>compared with other patients who underwent liver transplant during the same <br>period Results Re-exploration after liver transplant was done in 20 of <br>210(9.5%). Bleeding was the most common indication for re-exploration in <br>13(65%) patients and vascular complications were the cause in 5(25%) <br>patients, while wound dehiscence and early bile leak in 1 patient each. <br>Diaphragmatic surface was the most common site of bleeding in 7 patients <br>while bile duct cut surface in 2 patients and hepatic artery surface in 1 <br>patient while no site was identified in 3 patients. Of the 5 patients with <br>vascular complications 3 patients had <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (1 of 3 had <br>preoperative <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>) and 2 had arterial complications. <br>Re-exploration was done after a mean period of 3.8 days for the whole group <br>but patients who underwent re-exploration for bleeding were explored after <br>mean of 1.1 days. Mean postoperative stay was 18 days. 4 of 20 (20%) <br>patients expired within the study group and 3 of these patients were <br>explored for bleeding and one for Portal venous thrombosis. 3 patients <br>expired within 30 days of transplant while 1 patient expired after 2 months. <br>On long term follow up 1 patient expired after 2 years of liver transplant. <br>We compared our study group with other patients undergoing liver transplant <br>during the same study period in terms of age, sex, MELD score, GRWR, blood <br>transfusion, portal vein flow and postoperative morbidity, length of stay & <br>mortality and found no statistical significant difference between the two <br>groups apart from mortality which was higher in group undergoing <br>re-exploration (20% vs 11%). Conclusions Re-exploration after liver <br>transplant affects the short term outcomes without significant effect on <br>long term results.<br><br>RECORD 86<br>Transient impact of treatment exposures and one-year incidence of thrombosis <br>in multiple myeloma: A casetime-control analysis<br>Brown J. Moga D. Adams V.<br>Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016) 14 SUPPL. 1 (122). Date of <br>Publication: May 2016<br><br>Background: Multiple myeloma (MM) has an inherent high risk of thrombosis of <br>nearly exacerbated by specific treatment modalities. Aims: This study sought <br>to assess the acute, transient impact of treatment- related exposures on the <br>risk of thrombosis in MM. Methods: A case-time-control (CTC) analysis was <br>conducted within a larger cohort of patients with MM. Individuals were <br>identified by the first inpatient primary diagnosis of MM (ICD-9-CM 203.xx) <br>from administrative claims during 2008-2013. Individuals included were over <br>the age of 18 with continuous enrolment for 6 months preceding the index <br>date. Subjects were followed until loss to follow-up, death, or a thrombotic <br>event occurred (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, arterial <br>thrombosis, <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>). Cases included 502 subjects with at <br>least 90 days of look-back preceding the thrombosis event. Cases were <br>matched 1:4 with controls based by the year of MM diagnosis and controls <br>were assigned the same event date as the case. Exposures were assessed in <br>hazard (1-30 days) and comparison (61-90 days) periods preceding the event <br>for cases and controls. Conditional logistic regression was used to compute <br>adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for the transient effect of exposures on <br>thrombosis. Exposures of interest included thalidomide/lenalidomide (IMIDs), <br>protease inhibitors (PIs), steroids, cytotoxic agents, stem cell transplant, <br>hospitalizations, and <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. Results: The cohort included 13,700 <br>individuals with 1,050 thrombotic events - a rate of 107.2 (100.9-113.9) per <br>1,000 person-years. The CTC analysis showed transient risk associated with <br>IMIDs used alone (aOR=1.5 [1.1-2.1]) or with PIs (aOR=1.6 [1.0-2.6]). Stem <br>cell transplant had the highest transient impact on thrombosis (aOR=3.7 <br>[3.3- 4.2]). PIs alone had a lower impact on thrombosis (aOR=0.8 [0.5-1.4]). <br>Conclusions: CTC results identify exposures with increased transient risk <br>where surveillance and prophylaxis may be most useful.<br><br>RECORD 87<br>Endoscopic ultrasound guided injection of 2-octylcyanoacrylate for treatment <br>of refractory bleeding from peristomal varices<br>DeWitt J.M.<br>Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2016) 83:5 SUPPL. 1 (AB475-AB476). Date of <br>Publication: May 2016<br><br>Background: Bleeding peristomal varices are typically treated with topical <br>therapy, octreotide, percutaneous parastomal embolization, TIPS or <br>transplant. The role of EUS-guided injection of cyanoacrylate is limited to <br>a single case report. Aim: To report to a prospective, single center case <br>series of EUS-guided injection of 2-octylcyanoacrylate for treatment of <br>refractory bleeding from peristomal varices. Methods: An endoscopic database <br>of EUS-guided vascular therapy was queried for patients undergoing injection <br>of peristomal varices. All patients had ongoing bleeding despite failed <br>previous treatments or significant comorbidities precluding surgical, <br>radiologic or other treatments. During EUS, potential varices for treatment <br>were identified by doppler exam and traced distally to the stoma. Varix <br>injection was performed with a 19g or 22g needle under EUS guidance. No <br>coils were used for any patients. Follow up was performed by phone call and <br>review of hospital records. Results: From 4/2013-10/2015, seven patients <br>(mean age: 56 ± 11 yrs; 4F) were evaluated, including three hospitalized for <br>peristomal bleeding. Bleeding was daily in three and at least once weekly in <br>four. Six patients had cirrhosis (median MELD 10.5, range 9-38), whereas one <br>had <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> requiring <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. Previous TIPS and <br>liver transplant were performed in one patient each. Four patients had <br>recently failed: endoscopic cautery in two, IV octreotide in one and <br>surgical ligation in one. Prior to endoscopy, additional therapy was refused <br>by surgery in all and radiology in two. CT in four showed peristomal varices <br>in two but none in two. White light endoscopy into a previous ileostomy <br>(nZ6) or colostomy (nZ1) performed a median 12 years (range 4-33) prior to <br>referral was normal in all. Linear EUS located one (nZ4) or two (nZ2) <br>varices (median diameter 4mm, range 4-8) in six, but no varix was found in <br>one. Using a 19g (nZ5) or 22g (nZ1) needle, a median 1.5mL (range: 1-2) of <br>2-octylcyanoacrylate (Dermabond) was injected in 0.75-1mL aliquots. Median <br>follow up was 4.5 months (range 2-20). In 4/6 patients injected, bleeding <br>resolved completely and in one permitted liver transplant 3 weeks later. In <br>2/6, bleeding decreased significantly but did not resolve. In one of these <br>two, repeat hosptialization for peristomal bleeding occurred 4 months after <br>EUS followed by transplant one month later. No blood transfusions after EUS <br>were required in any patient. Treatment in three hospitalized patients <br>permitted eventual discharge. Adverse events included peristomal pain for <br>less than one week in three and minor bleeding in one after injection which <br>was treated with tamponade and application of bipolar probe to the stoma. <br>Conclusion: EUS-guided injection of 2- octylcyanoacrylate to peristomal <br>varices appears to be a promising technique to treat refractory bleeding in <br>this population.<br><br>RECORD 88<br>Thrombin generation assay and its application in the clinical laboratory<br>Tripodi A.<br>Clinical Chemistry (2016) 62:5 (699-707). Date of Publication: 1 May 2016<br><br>Background: A gap exists between in vivo and ex vivo coagulation when <br>investigated by use of the coagulation tests prothrombin time (PT) and <br>activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). The thrombin generation assay <br>(TGA) has been developed to fill this gap. CONTENT: TGA evaluates thrombin <br>generation (resulting from the action of the procoagulant driver) and decay <br>(resulting from the action of the anticoagulant driver), thus assessing the <br>balance between the two. Coagulation of the test plasma (platelet poor or <br>platelet rich) is activated by small amounts of tissue factor and <br>phospholipids, and the reaction of thrombin generation is continuously <br>monitored by means of a thrombin-specific fluorogenic substrate. Among the <br>parameters derived from the thrombin-generation curve, the most important is <br>the endogenous thrombin potential, defined as the net amount of thrombin <br>that test plasmas can generate on the basis of the relative strength of the <br>pro-and anticoagulant drivers. TGA is therefore the candidate assay to <br>investigate hypo-or hypercoagulability. SUMMARY: From my analysis of the <br>literature, I draw the following conclusions. There is strong evidence that <br>TGA is helpful to elucidate coagulation mechanisms in various clinical <br>conditions that until recently were poorly understood (chronic liver <br>disease; diabetes; inflammatory bowel disease, myeloproliferative neoplasms, <br>nonalcoholic fatty liver disease). TGA is a promising laboratory tool for <br>investigating hemorrhagic coagulopathies and monitoring replacement therapy <br>in hemophiliacs, predicting the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism <br>after a first event, and monitoring patients on parenteral or oral <br>anticoagulants. These applications require clinical trials in which TGA <br>results are combined with specific clinical end points.<br><br>RECORD 89<br>Hemostatic balance in patients with <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span>: Report of a consensus <br>conference<br>Andriulli A.

Date of <br>Publication: 13 Apr 2016<br><br>Background: RUNX1 (AML1) amplification in patients with B-cell acute <br>lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) has been associated with poor survival for <br>unclear reasons. Our anecdotal experience suggests that children with B-ALL <br>and RUNX1 amplification might be predisposed to thrombosis. Procedure: We <br>performed a retrospective cohort study of children with B-ALL treated from <br>2008 to 2014 at the North Carolina Children's Hospital. Patient <br>demographics, cytogenetics, and diagnosis of thrombosis were extracted by <br>blinded chart review. Analysis was performed examining the relationship <br>between RUNX1 amplification and thrombosis. Results: We identified 119 <br>patients with B-ALL and a median age of 4.9 years (interquartile range, 2.9 <br>to 8.6 y) at diagnosis. Four patients (3%) had RUNX1 amplification. The <br>average number of RUNX1 copies among those with amplification was 5 (SD 0.81 <br>[range, 4 to 6]). Eighteen thromboses were diagnosed within 6 months of <br>starting treatment. These events were more likely among patients with RUNX1 <br>amplification than in patients without amplification (75% vs. 13%; RR 5.75, <br>95% confidence interval, 2.75-12.01).

Date of Publication: <br>April 2016<br><br>Background and Aims: Non-cirrhotic, non-tumoral chronic portal vein <br>thrombosis (NC<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is caused by a prothrombotic condition in 1/3 of cases, a <br>local factor in other 1/3 of cases and is considered idiopathic in the <br>remaining 1/3 patients (pts). In NC<span style="color: red">PVT</span>, indefinite <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> is <br>recommended if a prothrombotic condition is found, if thrombosis is <br>manifested by severe intestinal ischemia or if familial thrombotic history <br>is present. However, the effectiveness of this attitude and/or the risk of <br>rethrombosis in pts not anticoagulated and in relation with the underlying <br>etiological conditions is scarce. The aim of the present study was to <br>evaluate the rate of rethrombosis in the splanchnic venous system and the <br>occurrence of any extrasplanchnic thrombotic events (EVE) in patients with <br>chronic NC<span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Methods: Patients prospectively included the REVASC registry <br>and followed routinely with repeated angio-CT-scan or angio-MRI in order to <br>assess the patency of the portal venous system were considered for <br>inclusion. For splanchnic rethrombosis the patients were censored at the <br>moment of rethrombosis or at the moment of the last imaging study. For EVE <br>pts were censored at last day of follow-up. Results: 108 pts were included, <br>39 with systemic prothombotic conditions (29 myeloproliferative diseases <br>(MPD) and 10 with prothombotic abnormalities), 35 with an identifiable local <br>factor and 34 were idiopathic, summing 652.75 person-years. During the <br>follow-up 14 (13%) pts had rethrombosis (asymptomatic in 7). The actuarial <br>rate of rethrombosis was 2, 6 and 12% at 1, 2 and 5 years, respectively. The <br>incidence of rethrombosis was 2.15 (95% CI: 1.17-3.59) per 100 person-years. <br>None of the 12 pts with NC<span style="color: red">PVT</span> idiopathic/local with <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>developed rethrombosis while this occurred in 11 out of 57 (19.2%) not <br>receiving <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. Three patients of those with MPD (10%) and none <br>of those with thrombophilia developed rethrombosis.

Date of Publication: <br>April 2016<br><br>INTRODUCTION Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is currently the most common <br>bariatric surgery at our institution. Portomesenteric vein thrombosis is a <br>relatively uncommon surgical complication with an insidious presentation and <br>a high risk of bowel compromise. The purpose of this study was to present a <br>series of patients who developed postoperative portomesenteric vein <br>thrombosis after sleeve gastrectomy, and to identify the associated risk <br>factors, overall incidence, clinical presentation and management. This is <br>the largest case series presented from North America. METHODS This is a <br>retrospective analysis of patients who underwent sleeve gastrectomy and <br>developed portomesenteric vein thrombosis. Demographic data, personal risk <br>factors, clinical presentation, and postoperative results of hypercoagulable <br>work up were analyzed in this study. RESULTS A total of 2185 laparoscopic <br>sleeve gastrectomies were performed from August 2011 till August 2015. <br>Twelve patients (0.55%) developed <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> after surgery. Out <br>of these patients seven were women and only two had a remote history of <br>smoking. Mean BMI was 42.7 (range 37 - 49), mean age was 43.1 (range 18 - 53 <br>years). Mean operative time was 67 minutes (range 44 - 90 minutes). <br>Abdominal pain was the most common symptom, presenting at a median of 14 <br>days (range 7 - 178 days) after sleeve gastrectomy. The most common <br>laboratory abnormalities were elevated alkaline phosphatase and lipase. CT <br>with IV contrast was performed in 11 patients, and was diagnostic in all. <br>Due to a severe contrast allergy the twelfth patient had a non-contrast CT <br>which was not diagnostic. Abdominal ultrasound identified portomesenteric <br>thrombosis in this patient, but failed to demonstrate it in three of the <br>other patients. Four patients in the study required additional surgical <br>intervention, including 2 small bowel resections. All patients were treated <br>with anti-coagulation with eventual resolution of symptoms. Six patients had <br>repeat interval imaging, but only two of them were found to have <br>radiographic resolution. Seven patients underwent hypercoagulable work up, <br>revealing an abnormality in five. CONCLUSIONS Portal vein and mesenteric <br>thrombosis is a relatively rare but morbid complication in patients <br>undergoing bariatric surgery. Immediate diagnosis and a high index of <br>suspicion is essential for the appropriate care of these patients.<br><br>RECORD 94<br>Inflammatory bowel disease is associated with an increased risk of arterial <br>and venous thrombosis in a tertiary hospital-based patient cohort<br>Gutta A. Redd M.K. Shah R. Jeepalyam S. Yousef O. Clarkston W.K.<br>Gastroenterology (2016) 150:4 SUPPL. 1 (S562). Date of Publication: April <br>2016<br><br>BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease are at an increased <br>risk of thromboembolic events when compared to the general population. AIM: <br>The aim of our study is to quantify the risk of arterial and venous <br>thrombosis in hospitalized patients with Crohns disease and Ulcerative <br>Colitis. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted to evaluate all <br>adult patients at Truman Medical Center, a primary teaching hospital for the <br>University of Missouri-Kansas City from January 1st, 2010 to December 31st, <br>2014 and 233,218 patients were identified. Using ICD-9 codes, a database <br>search was undertaken to identify patients with inflammatory bowel disease <br>as well as all patients diagnosed with arterial or venous thrombosis on <br>admission or during their hospitalization. Odds ratio was calculated to <br>assess the risk and was further adjusted using logistic regression. Patients <br>with acute diverticulitis, <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span>, pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer <br>and colon cancer were excluded from the study. RESULT: A total of 224,769 <br>patients admitted over a four-year period met the inclusion criteria. <br>Analysis of these patients showed that 2,056 (0.9%) patients had <br>thromboembolic events. 2,408 patients had IBD with 77 (3.2%) having arterial <br>or venous thrombosis. The distribution of embolic events included; DVT (45), <br>PE (27), unspecified arterial thrombosis (19), mesenteric arterial <br>thrombosis (3), mesenteric venous thrombosis (3), cerebral venous thrombosis <br>(1), cerebral artery thrombosis (1), and <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (2). <br>Patients with inflammatory bowel disease are 3.68 times (CI 2.92, 4.63) more <br>likely to develop a thrombosis when compared to a hospital-based patient <br>population without IBD. The risk decreased marginally to 2.88 (CI 2.23, <br>3.73) when adjusted for age, race, sex, smoking and BMI. The risk of <br>thrombosis in Crohns Disease was 2.64 (CI 1.49, 4.69) and Ulcerative Colitis <br>was 4.35 (CI 2.38, 7.96). The patients were also more likely to have a PE <br>with a risk of 3.32 (CI 2.26, 4.89) and a DVT with a risk of 3.53 (CI 2.62, <br>4.77) compared to other types of thrombosis. There was also a statistically <br>significant increased risk of arterial thrombosis at 7.8 (CI 5.1, 11.98) <br>over venous thrombosis at 3.44 (CI 2.68, 4.42). CONCLUSION: Inflammatory <br>bowel disease is associated with an increased risk of arterial and venous <br>thrombosis. The risk is higher in Ulcerative Colitis compared with Crohns <br>Disease, and there is a higher likelihood of DVT and PE, when compared to <br>other types of thrombosis. Close attention to prophylaxis of thromboembolism <br>in this patient population is critical. Further investigation must be done <br>to determine specific risk factors for thromboembolic disease in the IBD <br>patient population, and whether a high-risk subset of these patients would <br>benefit from long-term <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>.<br><br>RECORD 95<br>Tips versus endoscopy plus propranolol and <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> for variceal <br>rebleeding in cirrhotic patients with <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>: Results of a <br>randomized controlled trial<br>Qi X.

Date of Publication: <br>April 2016<br><br>Background and Aims: No consensus regarding the prevention of variceal <br>rebleeding in cirrhotic patients with <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) has been <br>established. A randomized controlled trial was conducted to prospectively <br>compare the efficacy of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) <br>versus conventional treatment (i.e., endoscopic treatment, propranolol, and <br>anticoagulants) in such patients. Methods: Cirrhotic patients with a history <br>of variceal bleeding and <span style="color: red">PVT</span> were randomized into TIPS with covered stents <br>group and conventional treatment group. Primary endpoint was variceal <br>rebleeding. Secondary endpoints included survival, complications, and portal <br>vein recanalization. Results: In TIPS group, 23 of 24 patients successfully <br>underwent TIPS procedures. In conventional treatment group, 5 of 25 patients <br>were transferred to TIPS procedures. During a median follow-up period of <br>20.9 months (range: 0.1-44.7), the 6- and 12-month cumulative rates of free <br>of variceal rebleeding were significantly higher in TIPS group than in <br>conventional treatment group (95% and 85% vs. 63% and 55%, p = 0.025). The <br>12- and 24-month cumulative rates of overall survival were 83% and 73% in <br>TIPS group and 88% and 84% in conventional treatment group (p = 0.228). <br>Complete disappearance of main <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> was more frequently <br>observed in TIPS group than in conventional treatment group (85% vs. 35%, p <br>= 0.001). The 6- and 12-month cumulative rates free of hepatic <br>encephalopathy were statistically similar between the two groups (77% and <br>77% vs. 82% and 78%, p = 0.888). Two patients developed shunt dysfunction in <br>TIPS group. Conclusions: Compared with conventional treatment, TIPS could <br>prevent from variceal rebleeding and improve the rate of portal vein <br>recanalization with a similar incidence of hepatic encephalopathy in <br>cirrhotic patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span>.<br><br>RECORD 96<br>Diagnosis of epigastric pain in the puerperium: A rare case of portal system <br>thrombosis with bilateral renal infarcts<br>Howell C. Belchita A. Chaudry M. Ciantar E.<br>BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (2016) 123 <br>SUPPL. 1 (33-34). Date of Publication: April 2016<br><br>Case At 4 weeks post emergency caesarean section, a 25-year-old woman was <br>admitted to hospital with epigastric pain and bilateral renal angle <br>tenderness. Investigation with ultrasound was unremarkable and the pain <br>settled. She was then readmitted with the same pain, requiring opiate <br>analgesia, and raised inflammatory markers. A computed tomography (CT) scan <br>of abdomen and pelvis revealed a <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> extending to the <br>superior mesenteric vein and splenic vein, and bilateral renal infarcts. Her <br>past medical and family history was unremarkable for venous thromboembolism, <br>thrombophilias or portal system pathology. Paroxysmal nocturnal <br>haemoglobulinuria and myeloproliferative disorders were excluded. She was <br>commenced on <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> under guidance of a multidisciplinary team. <br>Discussion The hypercoagulable physiological state of pregnancy is <br>well-known and predisposes women to venous thromboembolism in pregnancy and <br>up to 6 weeks postpartum. Portal system thrombosis is a particularly rare <br>event during pregnancy and postpartum. Episodes of portal system thrombosis <br>in the puerperium are very few, and nearly all reports are case reports. <br>Diagnosis is difficult because the clinical signs are nonspecific. The main <br>symptom was upper abdominal pain, which may be wrongly interpreted as a <br>gastric problem. Imaging with Doppler ultrasound and/or CT scan can lead to <br>an early diagnosis and treatment. Most cases of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> <br>reported in the literature during pregnancy or postpartum occurred against a <br>background of thrombophilia. In this case the patient had no personal or <br>family history of thrombophilia. The mortality rate of portal system <br>thrombosis in the puerperium is not higher than that of the general cases.<br><br>RECORD 97<br>Should <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> be offered in patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in the setting of <br>HCC?<br>Mahmoudi T.M. Kayal A. Carvalho R. Azalgara V.M. Weiss A.<br>Gastroenterology (2016) 150:4 SUPPL. 1 (S518-S519). Date of Publication: <br>April 2016<br><br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is a seen in about 20-44% of patients with <br>hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To our knowledge, no other study has looked <br>at the need for <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> (AC) in patients with HCC and <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. The aim <br>of this study is to investigate the natural history and progression of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>in patients with HCC with or without <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. Patients and Methods: <br>A cohort of 60 patients, 54 from the British Columbia Cancer Agency database <br>and 6 from the Vancouver general hospital thrombosis clinic, diagnosed with <br>both conditions, were evaluated retrospectively. 9 patients were excluded <br>secondary to lack of follow up. HCC and <span style="color: red">PVT</span> diagnosis and follow up was made <br>with contrast enhanced CT or MRI. Most patients received a single or a <br>combination of the following treatments: Transarterial chemoembolization, <br>radiofrequency ablation or surgical resection. 35(69%) of the patients <br>received systemic therapy with Sorafenib. Among the 51 patients evaluated, <br>12 patients received AC while 39 did not. Cox proportional hazards analysis <br>was used to determine the survival benefit of AC use and Pearson chi squared <br>analysis to access the impact of AC on <span style="color: red">PVT</span> extension in this patient <br>population. The date of November 26, 2015 was selected for administrative <br>censoring since 6 patients are still alive. Results: 42 patients were males <br>and mean age was 60.3. Liver disease etiology was HCV in 19(37%), HBV in <br>23(45%), ETOH in 8(15%) and hemochromatosis in 1(2%). Average survival after <br>HCC diagnosis was 32.9 months and 18.4 months after <span style="color: red">PVT</span> diagnosis. After <br>adjusting for age, HCC type at presentation (single VS multicentric) and <br>Child's Pugh score (a marker of liver function), AC was associated with an <br>improved survival after HCC diagnosis, adjusted hazard ratio was 0.37 (95% <br>confidence interval CI 0.14 to 0.99) and after <span style="color: red">PVT</span> diagnosis, 0.34 (95% CI <br>0.13-0.88). <span style="color: red">PVT</span> progression happened in 19(49%) of the non-AC group, and <br>6(50%) of the AC group. AC did not impact <span style="color: red">PVT</span> progression after adjusting <br>for HCC type at presentation and Child's Pugh score. Odds ratio was 1.32(95 <br>% CI 0.41-4.19). No symptoms directly related to <span style="color: red">PVT</span> development were <br>reported. Dalteparin was used in 7 patients and warfarin in 5 patients for <br>AC. Average length of AC was 7.8 months. Reasons for AC discontinuation <br>were: 2 patients had an UGI bleed, 1 patient had an intracranial bleed <br>secondary to brain metastasis, precautionary in high risk for bleed/fall in <br>4 patients, recanalization in 2 patients, 1 death from liver disease <br>decompensation. No reason was documented in 2 patients. Conclusion: This <br>study demonstrates that <span style="color: red">PVT</span> progression in patients with HCC is similar in <br>both anticoagulated and non-anticoagulated groups. There were no symptoms <br>attributable to <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in these patients. The possible <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> related <br>complications need to be considered before attempting therapy in patients <br>with HCC and <span style="color: red">PVT</span>.<br><br>RECORD 98<br>High-risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis liver transplant candidates are at <br>the greatest risk for pre-transplantation <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span><br>Stine J.G. Argo C.K. Pelletier S.J. Northup P.<br>Gastroenterology (2016) 150:4 SUPPL. 1 (S1118). Date of Publication: April <br>2016<br><br>Purpose: Given that liver transplant recipients who receive an organ for <br>high-risk nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (HR-NASH) have lower survival and <br>that NASH is associated with increased <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) risk, we <br>hypothesize that liver transplant candidates with HR-NASH are at increased <br>risk for <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Methods: Data on all transplants in the United States during <br>the MELD era through September 2014 were obtained with permission from the <br>United Network for Organ Sharing. Status 1a, multi-visceral, living donor, <br>re-transplants, pediatric recipients, donation after cardiac death, <br>recipients with pre-transplantation transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic <br>shunts and hepatocellular carcinoma were excluded. Recipients were sorted <br>into three distinct groups: those with HR-NASH, low-risk NASH (LRNASH) and <br>non-NASH (all other etiologies except cryptogenic cirrhosis, which was <br>excluded due to the potential for misclassification of NASH). HR-NASH was <br>defined as the presence of the following: age >65, BMI >30 kg/m(2) and <br>diabetes. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to <br>assess independent risk factors for pre-transplant <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Findings: 35,959 <br>candidates underwent liver transplantation and of those organ recipients, <br>505 were transplanted for HR-NASH and 2,796 for LR-NASH. 2,626 (7.5%) of <br>recipients had pretransplant <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, of which 68 (13.7%) were high-risk NASH <br>versus 326 (11.9%) low-risk NASH (p<0.001). In general, NASH recipients were <br>less likely to be male (p<0.001) or African American (p<0.001). While <br>severity of clinical liver disease (moderate-severe ascites and <br>encephalopathy) was similar amongst the groups, MELD scores both at listing <br>(HRNASH 19.4, 95% CI 18.7-20.1, 20.1 95%CI 19.8-20.5, non-NASH 19.6, 95%CI <br>19.5-19.7, p<0.001 when comparing HR to LR but no difference between HR and <br>non-NASH) and at allocation (HR-NASH 22.5, 95% CI 21.8-23.4, LR-NASH 23.7, <br>95% CI 23.4-24.0, non- NASH 22.8, 95% CI 22.7-22.9, p<0.001 when comparing <br>HR-NASH to LR-NASH but no difference between HR and non-NASH) were greatest <br>in the LR-NASH. BMI varied as well: HR-NASH 35.0 kg/m(2), 95% CI 34.7-35.4, <br>LR-NASH 31.7 kg/m(2), 95% CI 31.5-32.0, non- NASH 27.8 kg/m(2), 95% CI <br>27.7-27.9, p<0.001 for each within group comparison. In adjusted <br>multivariable regression analysis, recipients with HR-NASH had the greatest <br>risk of pre-transplant <span style="color: red">PVT</span> with OR 2.05 (95% CI 1.57-2.67, p=0.001) when <br>referenced to the non-NASH group and 33% greater risk when compared to <br>LR-NASH (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.49-1.97, p=0.044). Conclusions: Liver transplant <br>candidates with HR-NASH are at the highest risk for <span style="color: red">PVT</span> development. HR-NASH <br>patients may benefit from prophylactic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> to decrease their <br>likelihood of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> formation and resultant downstream hepatic decompensating <br>events.

Argo C.K. Pelletier S.J. Northup P.<br>Gastroenterology (2016) 150:4 SUPPL. 1 (S1034-S1035). Date of Publication: <br>April 2016<br><br>Purpose: To examine hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) risk factors in liver <br>transplant recipients. We hypothesize that recipients with pre-transplant <br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) who receive organs from high-risk donors are at <br>increased risk of HAT. Methods: Data on all transplants in the United States <br>during the MELD era through September 2014 were obtained from UNOS. Status <br>1a, multi-visceral, living donor, re-transplants, pediatric recipients, <br>donation after cardiac death and recipients with pre-transplantation <br>transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) were excluded. <br>Recipients were sorted into two groups: those with HAT and those without <br>HAT. Univariate comparisons were performed. Univariate comparisons were <br>performed. High-risk donors were defined as a Donor Risk Index (DRI) >1.7. <br>Incomplete HAT data were excluded. Multivariable logistic regression models <br>were constructed to assess independent risk factors for HAT with resultant <br>graft loss within 90 days of transplantation. Findings: 57,791 candidates <br>underwent liver transplantation and of those organ recipients, 5,700 had <br>complete data regarding HAT. 612 recipients had HAT and 65.7% (n=402) had <br>received organs from high-risk donors compared to 60.9% (n= 3,097) in <br>recipients without HAT (p=0.021). Pre-transplant <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was found in 13.2% (n= <br>81) of recipients with post-transplantation HAT versus 6.7% (n=339) in those <br>without HAT (p<0.001). 2,079 (3.6%) recipients had pre-transplantation <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>and received organs from high-risk donors. Recipients with HAT had similar <br>body mass index (28.4 m/kg2 95% CI 27.9-28.9 vs. 28.3 m/kg2, 95% CI <br>28.1-28.5, p=0.678), cold ischemia time (7.32 hours, 95% CI 6.96-7.69 vs. <br>7.43, 95% CI 7.32-7.55, p=0.530) and donor liver hepatic steatosis (8.5%, <br>95% CI 6.6-10.3 vs. 8.9, 9% CI 8.3-9.6, p=0.187) when compared to recipients <br>without HAT. On multivariable (adjusted) analysis, <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and high risk donors <br>were the most statistically significant independent risk factors for HAT (OR <br>2.09 95% CI 1.41-3.07, p= 0.002) and this risk was 39% higher than in those <br>recipients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and a low risk donor (OR 1.80 95% CI 1.12-2.91, <br>p=0.007). Recipients without <span style="color: red">PVT</span> with a high risk donor did not have an <br>increased risk of HAT. (OR 1.05 95% CI 0.82-1.35, p=0.169). Other <br>significant covariates included male donors (OR 0.51 95% CI 0.41-0.62, p <br><0.001), hepatocellular carcinoma (OR 0.65 95% CI 0.48-0.90, p=0.008), <br>heparin use at cross-clamp (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.51-0.90, p=0.008), and <br>international normalized ratio (INR) at transplantation (OR 0.86 95% CI <br>0.75-0.99, p=0.033). Conclusions: Candidates with pre-transplant <span style="color: red">PVT</span> who <br>receive an organ from a high-risk donor are at the highest risk for <br>post-operative HAT independent of other measurable factors.

Date of Publication: <br>April 2016<br><br>Background and Aims: The relationship between non-tumoral portal vein <br>thrombosis (NT<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) and occurrence of liver-related events in patients with <br>cirrhosis is uncertain. We evaluated the relation between NT<span style="color: red">PVT</span> and <br>end-stage liver disease in a cohort of cirrhotic patients. Methods: We <br>selected from the 2006 to 2015-hospital discharge database of our unit all <br>patients with cirrhosis. We excluded patients who developed hepatocellular <br>carcinoma during the study period, those who developed a NT<span style="color: red">PVT</span> after ESLD <br>and those with a follow-up below 6 months. Outcome measure was the <br>occurrence of non-cancerous liver-related complication (End-Stage Liver <br>Disease [ESLD]), including ascites, jaundice, hepatic encephalopathy, upper <br>digestive bleeding or liver failure. We evaluated the relation between <br>NT<span style="color: red">PVT</span>and ESLD in a Cox proportional model adjusted for age, gender, HCV or <br>HBV or HIV infections, alcohol use disorders, obesity, diabetes with time of <br>follow-up as the time-scale. Charlson index was also determined at entry and <br>tested in a separated model. Patients were censored at time of liver-related <br>event or at the last consultation. Results: 623 patients (median age: 54 <br>years (IQR: 47-63), 395 (63%) men) with compensated cirrhosis were available <br>at baseline. Median follow-up was 38 (IQR: 18-72) months. Positive anti-HCV <br>Ab, HBsAg and anti-HIV Ab were present in 360 (58%), 53 (8%) and 44 (7%) <br>patients, respectively. Alcohol use disorders, obesity and diabetes were <br>present in 258 (41%), 38 (6%) and 90 (14%) patients, respectively. The <br>occurrence of NT<span style="color: red">PVT</span> was recorded in 20 (3.2%) patients and 80 (12.8%) <br>patients developed ESLD. Patients with or without NT<span style="color: red">PVT</span> were not different <br>concerning age, sex or comorbidities. Alcohol use disorders (aHR: 1.93, p = <br>0.004), HBsAg positivity (aHR: 3.26, p < 0.0001), obesity (aHR: 2.38, p = <br>0.01) and NT<span style="color: red">PVT</span> (aHR: 3.21, p = 0.001) were independent risk factors of ESLD <br>(Figure 1). Adjusted on Charlson index, NT<span style="color: red">PVT</span> remained independently <br>associated with ESLD (aHR: 2.27, p = 0.002). Conclusions: NT<span style="color: red">PVT</span> affects <br>prognosis of patients with cirrhosis, regardless of comorbidities.

Kim D.-S. Yu Y.D. Jung S.W.<br>HPB (2016) 18 SUPPL. 1 (e231). Date of Publication: April 2016<br><br>Introduction: There have been a lot of reports for complications after <br>hepatectomy. However, studies for hepatectomy related thrombosis including <br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> have rarely reported. Authors evaluated risk factors <br>for post-hepatectomy thrombosis and clinical outcomes. Methods: From <br>February 2009 to December 2014, we analyzed retrospectively 534 patients who <br>had undergone hepatectomy at our hospital. The post-hepatectomy thrombosis <br>was defined as thrombosis which was seen in portal vein, hepatic vein and <br>inferior vena cava on postoperative imaging study. The patients with <br>pre-operatively confirmed thrombosis and tumor recurrence related thrombosis <br>were excluded. Results: Of the 534 patients, 22 (4.1%) developed thrombosis <br>after hepatectomy. Among them, <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> was 19 (86.4%) and <br>other site (hepatic vein and inferior vena cava) was 3 (13.6%). Proportion <br>of the patients who resected more than two sections such as lobectomy was <br>higher in post-hepatectomy thrombosis group (54.5 vs 35.2%). Patients with <br>thrombosis had a significantly longer operation time (p = 0.001) and it <br>occurred more commonly in cholangiocarcinoma patients in this study (p = <br>0.022). Although, there was no statistically significance, the mean duration <br>of Pringle's maneuver was longer in post-hepatectomy thrombosis group (24.3 <br>vs 17.7 minutes). 13 (59.1%) were received <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy and <br>almost of them (12 patients) were improved. Conclusion: Large resection <br>volume, longer operative time and duration of Pringle's maneuver are seemed <br>to be related with higher incidence of post-hepatectomy thrombosis. <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy is recommended for almost patients without <br>contraindications, especially for main <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> or possibility <br>of main portal flow disturbance.<br><br>RECORD 102<br>Enoxaparin reduces hepatic vascular resistance and portal pressure in <br>cirrhotic rats<br>Cerini F.

Date of Publication: 1 Apr 2016<br><br>Background & Aims Increased hepatic vascular resistance due to fibrosis and <br>elevated hepatic vascular tone is the primary factor in the development of <br>portal hypertension. Heparin may decrease fibrosis by inhibiting <br>intrahepatic microthrombosis and thrombin-mediated hepatic stellate cell <br>activation. In addition, heparin enhances eNOS activity, which may reduce <br>hepatic vascular tone. Our study aimed at evaluating the effects of acute, <br>short-, long-term and preventive enoxaparin administration on hepatic and <br>systemic hemodynamics, liver fibrosis and nitric oxide availability in <br>cirrhotic rats. Methods Enoxaparin (1.8 mg/kg subcutaneously), or its <br>vehicle, was administered to CCl(4)-cirrhotic rats 24 h and 1 h before the <br>study (acute), daily for 1 week (short-term) or daily for 3 weeks <br>(long-term) and to thioacetamide-cirrhotic rats daily for 3 weeks <br>with/without thioacetamide (preventive/long-term, respectively). Mean <br>arterial pressure, portal pressure, portal blood flow, hepatic vascular <br>resistance and molecular/cellular mechanisms were evaluated. Results No <br>significant changes in hemodynamic parameters were observed in acute <br>administration. However, one-week, three-week and preventive treatments <br>significantly decreased portal pressure mainly due to a decrease in hepatic <br>vascular resistance without significant changes in mean arterial pressure. <br>These findings were associated with significant reductions in liver <br>fibrosis, hepatic stellate cell activation, and desmin expression. Moreover, <br>a reduction in fibrin deposition was observed in enoxaparin-treated rats, <br>suggesting reduced intrahepatic microthrombosis. Conclusion Enoxaparin <br>reduces portal pressure in cirrhotic rats by improving the structural <br>component of increased liver resistance. These findings describe the <br>potentially beneficial effects of enoxaparin beyond the treatment/prevention <br>of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in cirrhosis, which deserve further investigation.<br><br>RECORD 103<br>Nontumoral <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in patients awaiting liver transplantation<br>Chen H.

Nearly half of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> cases are accidentally found <br>during the LT procedure. The most important risk factor for <span style="color: red">PVT</span> development <br>in cirrhosis may be the severity of liver disease and reduced portal blood <br>flow.

Noria S.F.<br>Surgical Endoscopy and Other Interventional Techniques (2016) 30 SUPPL. 1 <br>(S481). Date of Publication: March 2016<br><br>Introduction: Enoxaparin, a low molecular weight heparin, is often used <br>prophylactically to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events, and <br>therapeutically to bridge to full oral <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> postoperatively. In <br>individuals with obesity (BMI >30 kg/m(2)), there is concern regarding the <br>optimal dosing as drug distribution and pharmacokinetics may be altered. <br>While laboratory evaluation with anti-Xa levels has been proposed, risk of <br>thrombosis and hemorrhage have not been shown to correlate well with anti-Xa <br>levels. Overall risk of major hemorrhagic complications on low molecular <br>weight heparin is 1.1 %, however we noted several bleeding complications in <br>our patient population and decided to evaluate our experience and identify <br>risk factors that may be contribute to hemorrhagic complications. Methods: A <br>retrospective chart review was performed on postoperative patients <br>discharged, from a single surgical service, on therapeutic enoxaparin as a <br>bridge to full <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> from “year start”to “year finish”. <br>Demographic informations, surgical intervention and surgical complications <br>were reviewed to assess risks related to <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. Results: A total <br>of 41 patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 49.8 years with <br>68 % females and a mean BMI of 47.0 kg/m(2). Surgical interventions <br>included, sleeve gastrectomy (36.6 %), abdominal wall hernia repair (26.8 <br>%), Roux en Y gastric bypass (22 %), exploratory laparotomy (9.7 %) and <br>others (2.4 %). The indication for <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> included a history of <br>deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (75.6 %), atrial fibrillation (14.6 <br>%), <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (4.9 %), and other (4.9 %). Fifteen (36.6 %) <br>patients were readmitted for complications directly related to their <br>surgical intervention. Of these, 3 (7.6 %) were admitted secondary to <br>hemorrhagic complications and specific interventions included, (1) medical <br>management with blood transfusion and reversal of supratherapeutic <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, (2) transfusion and stenting of subsequent, possible <br>resultant, gastric sleeve leak, and (3) transfusion and empiric <br>embolization. Conclusions: Post-operative bridging of morbidly obese <br>patients with therapeutic enoxaparin should be approached with caution as <br>the incidence of hemorrhagic complications may be greater than expected. <br>However, further studies are needed to identify those at increased risk of <br>complications including more consistent evaluation of anti-Xa levels, both <br>at initial administration and at readmission, in order to adjust dosing or <br>pursue alternative options for <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>.<br><br>RECORD 105<br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> after laparoscopic bariatric surgery it's a rare <br>complication but should be considered: Description of three cases with <br>literature review<br>Ghasoup A.

Date of Publication: March 2016<br><br>Background: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) refers to an obstruction in the <br>trunk of the portal vein it's an uncommon complication after Laparoscopic <br>Bariatric Surgery (LBS) However it is a potentially lifethreatening <br>condition reported after laparoscopic bariatric surgery. Clinical symptoms <br>may be insidious, and progression can lead to intestinal infarction and <br>portal hypertension. Main Outcome Measures: Systematic review of the <br>literature on <span style="color: red">PVT</span> after LBS and report three cases encountered at our <br>institution. Patients and Methods: We reviewed the literature between <br>January 1990, and January 2015, using the search terms portal vein <br>thrombosis, mesenteric venous thrombosis, laparoscopic surgery and bariatric <br>surgery. The inclusion criteria were documented <span style="color: red">PVT</span> by imaging studies such <br>as angiography, ultrasonography, computed tomography [CT], or magnetic <br>resonance imaging (MRI) or surgery following LBS. We include three cases <br>after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy from our institution. Results: One <br>developed a chronic cavernoma with extension of the thrombus to the superior <br>mesenteric vein and splenic vein, the other two cases recovered using <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy. Conclusions: <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is a rare complication after LBS, <br>however Laparoscopic surgeons should be aware of the risk of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, and it <br>should be suspected in cases with an atypical outcome after LBS.

Date of Publication: 1 <br>Mar 2016<br><br>We report a case of Trousseau’s syndrome with cholangiocarcinoma complicated <br>by a fatal pulmonary embolism after liver biopsy. A 69-year-old man who <br>presented with right upper quadrant pain was found to have portal vein <br>thrombosis and nonspecific liver hypodensities after imaging by <br>comput­erized tomography. Following four days of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, heparin <br>was held for percutaneous liver biopsy. After the biopsy, he developed acute <br>hepatic failure, acute kidney injury, lactic acidemia, and expired. Autopsy <br>revealed intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and a pulmonary embolism. <br>Trousseau’s syndrome with cholangiocarcinoma is rarely reported and has a <br>poor prognosis. This case highlights a fundamental challenge in the <br>diagnosis and early management of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with <br>hypercoagulability. Diagnostic biopsy creates an imperative to reduce <br>post-operative bleeding risk, but this conflicts with the need to reduce <br>thrombotic risk in a hypercoagulable state. Considering the risk of <br>withholding <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in patients with proven or suspected <br>cholangiocarcinoma complicated by <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>, physicians should <br>consider biopsy procedures with lesser bleeding risks, such as transjugular <br>liver biopsy or plugged percutaneous liver biopsy, to minimize interruption <br>of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>.<br><br>RECORD 107<br>Occult portal venous system thrombosis complicating acute pancreatitis: <br>Three case reports and a literature review<br>Li S.

Date of Publication: 29 Feb 2016<br><br>Portal venous system thrombosis (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is a relative rare complication of <br>acute pancreatitis (AP), especially in China, and the incidence thereof in <br>published studies may be overestimated. The management of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> complicat­ing <br>AP by the use of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy remains controversial due to the <br>lack of standardized treatment.

Date of Publication: <br>24 Feb 2016<br><br>Background and aim: Non-neoplastic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is a <br>frequent event in cirrhotic patients but its natural history is poorly <br>understood. It can be treated with anticoagulants, however the safety and <br>efficacy of this therapeutic approach are still unknown. We performed a <br>retrospective study evaluating the effect of anticoagulants in a series of <br>cirrhotic patients with nonneoplastic <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Material and methods: A <br>retrospective ultrasound chart review of cirrhotic patients seen in our <br>Liver Unit between February 2008 and March 2015 was performed. Subjects with <br>non-neoplastic <span style="color: red">PVT</span> (defined as the absence of invasion or infiltration of <br>the portal vein by neoplasia) were identified by reviewing US and TC <br>reports. Partial vs complete <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was considered as the absence or presence <br>of power- Doppler signal at the ultrasound. Demographic, clinical, <br>laboratory, endoscopic parameters and thrombophilia screening were analyzed. <br>Dose, duration, efficacy and side effects of anticoagulant therapy were also <br>evaluated. Results: Charts of 375 cirrhotic patients of any etiology were <br>evaluated. Non-neoplastic <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was identified in 28 cases (7,5%) and it was <br>mostly partial. Low platelet count, high MELD score (13±4), Child-Pugh class <br>B or C and esophageal varices were the most frequent characteristics of <br>these patients. Trombophilic disorders (antithrombin deficiency, protein C <br>deficiency, protein S deficiency, presence of Lupus Anticoagulant <br>antibodies) were observed in 9 patients; 16 patients received <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy (low-weight heparin or warfarin) for 3-6 months and <br>12 patients received no treatment. Partial or complete recanalization was <br>achieved in 12 anticoagulated patients (75%), while in 3 patients (25%) <br>spontaneous improvement of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> (p=0,025) was observed. The recurrence of <br>thrombosis was seen in 43% patients after stopping <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy. <br>Five anticoagulated patients developed bleeding complications but no deaths <br>were observed. Ten patients without treatment developed liver-related events <br>(portal hypertension-related bleeding, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy) and <br>4 patients died. Conclusions: In our study, <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy is a <br>safe treatment for <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, leading to recanalization of the portal vein in 75% <br>of patients.

Date of <br>Publication: 10 Feb 2016<br><br>Introduction and aims: Fondaparinux (FPX), a factor Xa inhibitor, has been <br>recommended for <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy in patients deep vein thrombosis. It <br>rarely induces thrombocytopenia since anti-PF4/heparin antibodies which are <br>rarely generated during FPX treatment, are not able to bind PF4/FPX <br>complexes. Despite these potential advantages, there are no data regarding <br>the use of FPX as anticoagulant treatment of acute nonmalignant portal vein <br>thrombosis (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) in patients with <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span>. The aim of this <br>prospective pilot study was to evaluate the safety, and efficacy of <br>subcutaneous FPX therapy in patients with cirrhosis and <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Methods: <br>Forty-two patients with <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> and acute nonmalignant <span style="color: red">PVT</span> were <br>included in the study between 2010 and 2014. The extension of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> at <br>baseline and its evolution on treatment were evaluated by both Doppler <br>ultrasound and CT. The dose of FPX was adjusted to body weight, and on <br>platelet count, ranging from 2.5 to 7.5 mg/die. Results: At baseline, 31 <br>patients (74%) had a platelet count lower than 70×10(3)/mm(3), while 19 <br>(45%) had a platelet count < 50×10(3)/mm(3). After a mean period of 16±14 <br>months of treatment, 18 patients (43%) showed a complete resolution of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. <br>Ten patients (24%) showed a partial resolution. Fourteen patients (33%) <br>showed no response or a progression of thrombosis. One patient developed a <br>non-lethal major bleeding event (haemoperitoneum three day after <br>paracentesis) while 5 patients developed a non-major bleeding events during <br>the study (14%). In all these patients but one FPX was discontinued. No <br>significant change was observed in the platelet count before and during <br>treatment (67×10(3)/mm(3) vs 68×10(3)/mm(3), p = N.S.). Conclusions: In <br>patients with cirrhosis and marked thrombocytopenia, FPX seems to be <br>effective and safe in the treatment of acute nonmalignant <span style="color: red">PVT</span>.<br><br>RECORD 111<br>Treatment of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in cirrhosis: A multicenter real life <br>study<br>Samonakis D.N.

We assessed <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> on this population for safety, <br>efficacy and survival. Method: Cirrhotics with <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, the majority <br>decompensated, were included in a data base retrospectively (before 2013) <br>and prospectively (2013-10/2014). Demographics: 76 patients (61 male), <br>median age 67 (36-88) and BMI 26.8 (17.9-32.4), etiologies: alcoholic 40 %, <br>HBV 25 % and HCV 16 %, HCC in 47.4 %. Median MELD-score was 12 (6-25), <br>Child-Pugh 7 (5-12).79.5 % of patients were decompensated at <span style="color: red">PVT</span> diagnosis, <br>89.6 % had varices (62.5 % large), 33 % high-risk signs. Main trunk <br>involvement in 77 %, cavernoma existed in 17 %. 51 patients anticoagulated <br>(65 % LMW-Heparin, 25 % warfarin). Pretreatment varices eradicated in 30 %, <br>while a 75 % of patients were on beta-blockers. Survival was inferior for <br>treated (median 15 months) albeit not statistically (ns)-significant (p = <br>0.311); HCC patients had n.s. trend for inferior survival as for alcoholics <br>(p = 0.06).

Date of Publication: <br>February 2016<br><br>Background: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is a complication of cirrhosis that <br>reduces the hepatic reserve and causes variceal bleeding. The therapeutic <br>efficacy of danaparoid sodium (DS), a heparinoid anti-coagulation factor Xa, <br>for <span style="color: red">PVT</span> has been reported. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 41 <br>hospitalized cirrhotic patients: 16 hepatitis C virus, 5 hepatitis B virus, <br>20 others; the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score 8.6 ± 4.7; <br>platelets 80 ± 40 × 10(3)/μL; 3 esophageal varices F0, 16 F1, 5 F2, 0 F3, <br>and 17 unknown.

The volume of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>V) measured with a threedimensional- <br>image analyzer (n = 28), serum D-dimer (n = 29), and scintigraphic portal <br>shunt indices (normal, <10 %; n = 6) were monitored. Results: Thrombi formed <br>at one site in 25 patients (18 portal, 4 superior mesenteric, and 3 splenic <br>veins) and at two or more sites in 16. At the end of DS therapy, the <span style="color: red">PVT</span>V <br>decreased to 55.1 ± 40.2 % of baseline (8.6 ± 10.3 cm(3), p<0.0001), D-dimer <br>decreased from 11.8 ± 12.6 μg/mL to 7.0 ± 7.4 μg/mL (p = 0.007), and the <br>shunt indices decreased from 62.4 ± 10.5 % to 56.9 ± 7.1 % (p = 0.250). <br>During DS therapy, Grade 2 intraperitoneal bleeding occurred in one patient <br>(2.4 %).

Study <br>Selection: Studies written in the English language from January 2000 to <br>December 2015 were considered for this review article. All search results <br>were reviewed, and the relevance of each article was determined by authors <br>independently. Conclusions: Patients with cirrhosis are at higher risk for <br>both bleeding and thrombosis-related complications. Cirrhosis affects <br>production of both procoagulant and anticoagulant factors, thus resulting in <br>increased INR and aPTT levels and decreased anti-Xa levels. LMWH is the <br>treatment of choice for the prevention and treatment of DVT/PE/<span style="color: red">PVT</span> in <br>patients with cirrhosis, and monitoring with anti-Xa levels for dose <br>adjustment is not recommended.

Date of Publication: 2016<br><br>Learning Objectives 1. To review current indications for TIPS in hepatic <br>and/or <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> 2. To learn about additional techniques in <br>these settings 3. To review results of TIPS in patients with the hepatic <br>vein thrombosis, and acute or chronic thrombosis of the portal vein Portal <br>vein thrombosis (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) and Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) are caused by <br>thrombotic obstruction of the extrahepatic portal veins and the hepatic <br>venous outflow, respectively, usually producing significant symptoms of <br>portal hypertension. Several heterogenous prothrombotic disorders in <br>combination with local triggering factors have been implicated in causing <br>this thrombosis. Medical management, including <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, forms the <br>backbone in treating both disorders; radiological and surgical intervention <br>being reserved for refractory and severely symptomatic cases. Amongst these, <br>TIPS has traditionally been considered a relative contraindication, as <br>technical challenges produced by the occluded veins often resulted in <br>procedural failure. However, the past decade has witnessed better procedural <br>and clinical success rates, and consequently, TIPS is being increasingly <br>offered to treat complications of portal hypertension in this group of <br>patients. A. <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> The aim of treatment in <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is to <br>reverse or prevent progression of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and to treat complications of portal <br>hypertension. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> results in recanalisation of acute <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in <br>majority of patients and minimises serious complications like bowel ischemia <br>and development of varices, provided it is initiated early. Most often, <br>however, patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> manifest at a chronic stage where <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>cannot reverse complications like variceal bleeding, symptomatic portal <br>biliopathy and hypersplenism. Variceal bleeding in such cases is managed in <br>standard fashion, using vasoconstrictors, antibiotics and endoscopic <br>treatment. TIPS can be offered in these patients if the bleeding is not <br>controlled or if it recurs despite conventional therapy. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> occurs in up to <br>26% of patients with <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span>, and in this setting it has been <br>proposed that an occlusive <span style="color: red">PVT</span> potentially changes the natural history of <br><span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> as it increases the incidence of variceal bleeding and <br>decreases the patients' survival. Conceptually, TIPS would benefit these <br>patients by not only resolving the portal hypertension, but also improving <br>transplant outcomes as it allows for a more physiological and durable <br>end-to-end anastomosis. Technique of TIPS in <span style="color: red">PVT</span> TIPS is challenging in the <br>presence of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> due to difficulty encountered during portal vein access. The <br>procedure is essentially done in 2 steps. In the first step, the portal vein <br>is recanalised using a transjugular, transhepatic, transplenic or <br>transmesenteric approach. Once the portal vein is recanalised, the TIPS is <br>completed in routine fashion from jugular venous access For initial portal <br>vein recanalisation, the portal vein can be approached from various routes: <br>Transjugular access: The technique is similar to TIPS, wherein a liver <br>access needle is advanced across the liver parenchyma into a patent <br>peripheral portal venous branch from the jugular puncture. Once in the <br>peripheral branch, a curved angiographic catheter and hydrophilic wire are <br>then advanced and manipulated across the portal vein occlusion. Transhepatic <br>access: Here, a peripheral portal venous radicle is accessed percutaneously <br>using US or fluoroscopy, following which an angiographic catheter and <br>hydrophilic wire is manipulated across the occluded portal vein. <br>Transsplenic access: In this method, a splenic hilar vein is accessed <br>percutaneously and catheter advanced to reach the portal vein occlusion and <br>cross it retrogradely. Transmesenteric access: A mini-laparotomy is <br>performed in the angiography suite to expose an ileal loop. A sheath is then <br>placed within the ileal vein, through which the angiographic catheter and <br>wire are advanced through the occluded portal vein. Once access into the <br>portal vein is gained, the occluded segment can be recanalised using a <br>variety of techniques, depending on the age of the thrombus. An acute portal <br>vein thrombus can be effectively removed by thrombolysis, thromboaspiration, <br>and/or mechanical thrombectomy. Alternatively, the thrombus can be trawled <br>into the intrahepatic portal venous radicles using a Fogarty thrombectomy <br>catheter. Any residual flow limiting thrombus that is refractory to these <br>therapies is generally dilated or stented. A chronic portal vein occlusion <br>is treated with angioplasty and/or stenting with either bare or covered <br>stents. TIPS is generally inserted after the portal vein is recanalised. <br>This is fairly straightforward if the initial access to the portal vein is <br>transjugular, as the recanalisation and TIPS creation would be over the same <br>wire access. However, if the initial access is from any approach other than <br>jugular, the conversion to TIPS requires a portal vein target for the TIPS <br>needle. This can be achieved by positioning a snare or an inflated balloon <br>in the recanalised portal vein or by guiding the needle toward the top of <br>end the portal vein stent. Once the portal vein entry is successful, the <br>TIPS is placed in standard fashion. Results of TIPS in <span style="color: red">PVT</span> TIPS can be <br>successfully inserted in <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in almost 99.5% of patients <br>when thrombosis is partial. The success rates drop to 79% when the portal <br>vein is completely occluded, and dip further to 63% when the occlusion is <br>chronic, suggested by presence of a portal cavernoma. A successful TIPS <br>reduces the incidence of variceal rebleeding significantly. A 1- and 5-year <br>cumulative variceal rebleeding rate of 10% and 28% is noted in patients of <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span> that had a TIPS inserted, versus 43% and 100% for patients that did not <br>succeed in getting a TIPS. Also, the short-term survival with TIPS is <br>excellent (the 1- and 2-year cumulative survival rates are 80-89% and <br>72-81%), and the longterm prognosis in these patients appears to be higher <br>than general patients with decompensated cirrhosis. B. Budd-Chiari syndrome <br>Hepatic venous outflow obstruction causes an increase in hepatic sinusoidal <br>pressure that leads to a cascade of events, beginning with hepatocellular <br>congestion, necrosis and finally cirrhosis. Depending on extent of venous <br>involvement, speed of occlusion, and degree of venous collateralisation, <br>manifestation can vary markedly, ranging from asymptomatic disease to <br>fulminant liver failure. Majority of patients present with abdominal pain, <br>ascites, hepatosplenomegaly, dilated abdominal wall veins, leg oedema and <br>near normal liver function despite overt portal hypertension. <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> and, if possible, treatment of underlying disorders (e.g. <br>myeloproliferative disease, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria) form the <br>cornerstone of therapy in BCS, and should be initiated as early as possible <br>in the disease. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> alone will succeed in controlling liver <br>disease in 10% of patients. Next, whenever possible, recanalisation of the <br>hepatic venous outflow by angioplasty and stenting should be attempted, as <br>it is a low risk procedure that decongests the liver while maintaining <br>physiological blood flow. TIPS is recommended in symptomatic patients with <br>BCS when (a) the hepatic vein occlusive segment is long, (b) there is <br>failure to recanalise the hepatic veins, or (c) there is no clinical benefit <br>from hepatic vein recanalisation. Technique of TIPS in BCS The procedure of <br>TIPS requires few technical modifications. Since the hepatic veins are <br>occluded, parenchymal puncture is initiated either from a stump of the <br>hepatic vein or directly from the retrohepatic IVC, usually about 2-6 cm <br>distance from the right atrium. To aid penetration through the IVC wall, a <br>left sided jugular approach is preferred by some, as is the use of a coaxial <br>21G fine needle. Either maneuver embeds the needle in the caval wall and <br>prevents it from sliding down the IVC. Once the caval wall is penetrated, <br>the needle is advanced through the liver parenchyma toward the hepatic <br>hilum. With each throw of the needle into the liver parenchyma, entry into <br>the portal vein is best confirmed by injection of contrast (PTC-style) <br>rather than aspiration of blood, as blood is invariably aspirated from the <br>congested liver or from small intra-hepatic venous collaterals. Longer and <br>more frequent throws of the needle should be anticipated, as the liver is <br>enlarged; most parenchymal tracts from the IVC to the portal vein extend <br>over 7-10 cm in length. The liver is also much softer and congested. This <br>feature, along with the longer tracts and frequent needle passes, <br>potentially increases the risk of intraperitoneal hemorrhage, intrahepatic <br>hematomas or pseudoaneurysms. Utilisation of a fine needle and aids to <br>target the portal vein can reduce this risk. Results of TIPS in BCS TIPS has <br>become the preferred form of treatment when medical therapy has failed, as <br>it provides improvement in clinical symptoms and liver function and arrests <br>progression of liver fibrosis. One of the largest multi-centre study on TIPS <br>in BCS revealed technical success in over 90%, and a 1- and 10-year <br>transplant-free survival of 88% and 69%, respectively. Although TIPS-related <br>complications are not infrequent, procedural mortality is rare. Patients <br>with BCS are known to have a high incidence of TIPS dysfunction from intimal <br>hyperplasia and thrombotic occlusion, requiring frequent re-interventions to <br>maintain its patency. Covered stents have improved the patency rates <br>significantly, with 6- and 12-month patency rates of 100% and 85.7%, <br>respectively, compared to 16.7% and 0% for bare stents; hence, its use is <br>strongly recommended in BCS.<br><br>RECORD 118<br>EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Vascular diseases of the liver<br>Garcia-Pagán J.C.<br>Journal of Hepatology (2016) 64:1 (179-202).

Date of Publication: 2016<br><br>Background: Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are used in patients <br>with splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) and cirrhosis, but evidence for safety <br>and efficacy in this setting is limited. Our aim was to identify indications <br>and reasons for starting or switching to DOACs and to report adverse <br>effects, complications and short-term outcome. Methods: Data collection <br>including demographic information, laboratory values, treatment and <br>complications through the Vascular Liver Disease Interest Group Consortium. <br>Results: Forty-five centres (90%) of the consortium completed the initial <br>eCRF. We report here a series of 94 patients from 17 centres. Thirty-six <br>patients (38%) had cirrhosis. Child-Pugh score was 6 (range 5-8), and MELD <br>score 10.2 (range 6-19). Indications for <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> were splanchnic <br>vein thrombosis (75%), deep vein thrombosis (5%), atrial fibrillation (14%) <br>and others (6%). DOACs used were rivaroxaban (83%), dabigatran (11%) and <br>apixaban (6%). Patients were followed up for a median duration of 15 months <br>(cirrhotic) and 26.5 months (non-cirrhotic). Adverse events occurred in 17% <br>of patients and included one case of recurrent <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> and <br>five cases of bleeding. Treatment with DOACs was stopped in three cases. The <br>major reasons for choosing DOACs were no need for monitoring or inadequacy <br>of INR to guide <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in cirrhotic patients.

McDow A. Poola R. Fratianni C.M. Garfinkel M. Jakoby M.G.<br>Endocrine Reviews (2016) 37:2 Supplement 1. Date of Publication: 2016<br><br>Background: The hallmark manifestations of Cushing's syndrome (CS) are well <br>known, but hypercoagulability is perhaps least recognized. Patients with <br>Cushing's syndrome are at increased risk of both postoperative and <br>spontaneous thromboembolic events. Expression of factors that favor <br>clotting, chiefly factors VIII, IX, and von Willebrand factor, are <br>increased, and fibrinolytic capacity is reduced by increased expression of <br>plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. We report an unusual patient whose CS was <br>diagnosed during evaluation of unprovoked <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. Case: A 61 <br>year-old female with history of hypertension and rheumatoid arthritis <br>presented to her physician for evaluation of abrupt onset upper abdominal <br>pain, nausea, fevers, and chills. Computed tomography of the abdomen <br>revealed complete thrombosis of the left intrahepatic portal vein and a 3.5 <br>cm, well circumscribed, and low attenuation left adrenal nodule. Examination <br>was notable for mild hypertension, moon facies, plethora, hirsutism, <br>dorsocervical fat pad hypertrophy, and scattered bruises. Midnight plasma <br>cortisol (10.5 mg/dL, expected < 7.5), midnight salivary cortisol (550 <br>ng/dL, expected < 100), and 24 hr urine free cortisol (146 mg, ref 3.5-45) <br>were all unequivocally elevated, and 8 AM ACTH level was suppressed (7.2 <br>pg/mL, ref 10-60) consistent with adrenal hypercortisolemia. Evaluation for <br>other potential etiologies of thrombosis, including procoagulant antibodies <br>(e.g. antiphospholipid antibodies), deficiencies of protein C, protein S, <br>and antithrombin III, prothrombin G2021A mutation, and activated protein C <br>resistance was unremarkable. Acute symptoms resolved on treatment with <br>heparin and parenteral antibiotics. After three months of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>with warfarin, the patient underwent an uneventful laparoscopic left <br>adrenalectomy. Postsurgical pathology confirmed an adrenal adenoma. <br>Conclusions: Approximately 8-10% of patients with CS experience deep vein <br>thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, with slightly more than half of events <br>related to surgery and the rest occurring spontaneously. Most cases of <br>venous thrombosis occur in the lower extremities. A PubMed search with the <br>terms “<span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>” and “Cushing's syndrome” yields only one <br>brief French language case report; to the best of our knowledge, this is <br>only the second reported case of CS complicated by spontaneous portal vein <br>thrombosis. Hypercoagulability is an important complication of <br>hypercortisolemia, and CS should be considered in the differential diagnosis <br>of spontaneous deep vein thrombosis. CS patients undergoing surgery require <br>close observation and perioperative thromboprophylaxis.<br><br>RECORD 122<br>Guidance for the management of venous thrombosis in unusual sites<br>Ageno W.

Date of <br>Publication: 1 Jan 2016<br><br>Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a serious and often fatal medical condition <br>with an increasing incidence. The treatment of VTE is undergoing tremendous <br>changes with the introduction of the new direct oral anticoagulants and <br>clinicians need to understand new treatment paradigms. This manuscript, <br>initiated by the <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> Forum, provides clinical guidance based on <br>existing guidelines and consensus expert opinion where guidelines are <br>lacking. In this chapter, we address the management of patients presenting <br>with venous thrombosis in unusual sites, such as cerebral vein thrombosis, <br>splanchnic vein thrombosis, and retinal vein occlusion. These events are <br>less common than venous thrombosis of the lower limbs or pulmonary embolism, <br>but are often more challenging, both for the severity of clinical <br>presentations and outcomes and for the substantial lack of adequate evidence <br>from clinical trials. Based on the available data, we suggest anticoagulant <br>treatment for all patients with cerebral vein thrombosis and splanchnic vein <br>thrombosis. However, in both groups a non-negligible proportion of patients <br>may present with concomitant bleeding at the time of diagnosis. This should <br>not contraindicate immediate <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in patients with cerebral vein <br>thrombosis, whereas for patients with splanchnic vein thrombosis <br>anticoagulant treatment should be considered only after the bleeding source <br>has been successfully treated and after a careful assessment of the risk of <br>recurrence. Finally, there is no sufficient evidence to support the routine <br>use of antithrombotic drugs in patients with retinal vein occlusion. Future <br>studies need to assess the safety and efficacy of the direct oral <br>anticoagulants in these settings.<br><br>RECORD 123<br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span><br>Malik A.

Date of Publication: 2016<br><br>Introduction <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is defined as the presence of <br>thrombus in the trunk of PV and/or its right and left intra-hepatic <br>branches. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> can be classified as acute or chronic, intra or extra-hepatic <br>and occlusive or non-occlusive. Patients may be asymptomatic or present with <br>upper GI bleeding or abdominal pain. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in cirrhotic patients can present <br>with acute decompensation such as ascites or variceal bleeding. Methods A <br>retrospective review of all radiological diagnoses of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was done with a <br>view to understanding the aetiology, clinical spectrum, treatment and <br>prognosis of patients managed under a large district hospital. Results A <br>total of 115 patients, median age 62 years (range 25 to 90) were diagnosed <br>with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> between 2010 and 2015, of whom 71 (62%) were male. Usual <br>indications for radiological investigations were abdominal pain, weight loss <br>and decompensation or routine surveillance in cirrhotic patients. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was <br>intra-hepatic alone in 29 patients and extra-hepatic with or without <br>intra-hepatic extension in the rest. Cavernous transformation was reported <br>in 11 patients. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was most commonly seen in association with abdominal <br>malignancy (55 cases - 48%) being due to HCC in 21 cases and other local or <br>metastatic abdominal malignancy in 34. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was observed to be due to <br>pancreatitis in 21 cases, <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> without HCC in 15, acute <br>diverticulitis/cholecystitis in 6, post surgical in 4 with no clear cause <br>identified in just 14 cases (12%). Thrombophilia screening was performed in <br>11/14 patients with unclear aetiology and was positive in 3 (1 JAK-2 <br>positive, 1 elevated anti-b2GP1 antibodies, 1 low in both protein C and S, <br>rest negative), 2/15 patients with <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> (both negative) and 4/86 <br>(1 positive for lupus anti-coagulant) of remaining patients. In total 24 <br>patients were anticoagulated whilst 3 patients were already on warfarin for <br>atrial fibrillation. Of these, 10 were patients of unclear aetiology, 4 with <br>cirrhosis without HCC, 3 had diverticulitis, 3 local or metastatic <br>malignancy, 2 pancreatitis, 1 cholecystitis and 1 post surgical. Eleven of <br>the 15 patients with cirrhosis and <span style="color: red">PVT</span> died, typically from hepatic <br>decompensation with a median life expectancy of 8 months (range 1-48 <br>months).

Date of <br>Publication: 1 Jan 2016<br><br>Background: Obesity is common after solid organ transplantation and is <br>associated with worse transplantation-related outcomes. Laparoscopic sleeve <br>gastrectomy (LSG) may be the preferred bariatric operation in <br>transplantation patients over other techniques, such as gastric bypass, <br>given the concerns about medication absorption. However, little is known <br>about LSG outcomes in posttransplantation patients. Objectives: We report <br>the outcomes in 10 consecutive patients who underwent solid organ <br>transplantation followed by LSG. Setting: An academic medical center. <br>Methods: Primary outcomes studied were weight loss, perioperative <br>complications, resolution or improvement of obesity-related co-morbidities, <br>and markers of graft function following LSG. Results: The types of <br>transplantation before LSG were as follows: liver = 5, kidney = 4, and heart <br>= 1. Mean body mass index (BMI) at LSG was 44.7 ±1.7 kg/m . All patients had <br>hypertension, and 6 had type 2 diabetes. Perioperative complications <br>occurred in 2 patients, and there were no deaths. Excess weight loss at 12 <br>and 24 months after LSG was 45.7% and 42.5%, respectively. At 1 year after <br>LSG, there was a significant reduction in the number of antihypertensive <br>medications (2.4 to 1.5; P = .02). Three patients achieved complete <br>remission of type 2 diabetes, and the other 3 significantly reduced their <br>dosages of insulin. Graft function remained preserved in liver <br>transplantation patients; left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <br>increased by 10% in the heart transplantation subject, and the estimated <br>glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) increased significantly in kidney <br>transplantation patients (53 ± 3 to 82 ± 3 mL/min; P = .03). Conclusions: We <br>concluded that LSG, in selected patients with severe obesity after solid <br>organ transplantation, results in significant weight loss, improvement or <br>resolution of obesity-related conditions, and preservation or improvement of <br>graft function.

For untreated patients, the thrombosis <br>had improved in four patients (25%), was stable in six patients (37.5%), and <br>progressed in six patients (37.5%). The <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> group had <br>significantly better recanalization rates than the untreated group <br>(P=0.011). Degree of superior mesenteric vein (P=0.032, hazard ratio: 15.4; <br>95% confidence interval: 1.3-200) was a significant predictor. In addition, <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> can effectively improve <span style="color: red">PVT</span> with a degree less than 75% in <br>the main portal vein compared with untreated patients (6/6 vs. 2/6, P= <br>0.030). The probability of hepatic decompensation at 1 year was 15.6 and <br>17.9% between the <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> and the untreated groups (P= 0.847). <br>Albumin (P= 0.06, hazard ratio: 0.860; 95% confidence interval: 0.772-0.959) <br>was a significant predictor. Conclusion <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> with warfarin might <br>result in the resolution of more advanced <span style="color: red">PVT</span> effectively and safely in <br>patients with <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span>.

Date of <br>Publication: 2016<br><br>Background and aims The reported rate of incidence of neonatal portal vein <br>thrombosis (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is 36 per 1000 neonatal intensive care admissions, may in <br>fact be higher. There is paucity of literature describing outcomes of <br>neonatal <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. The aim of our study was to describe the outcomes of neonatal <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span> in order to facilitate clinical decisions regarding the need for <br>aggressive potential treatment strategies. Methods Retrospective chart <br>review of neonates diagnosed with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> between January, 2008 and December, <br>2015 in a tertiary care neonatal unit. Results Eighteen premature (mean <br>gestational age (GA): 31.6 weeks) and 19 term (mean GA: 39.1 weeks) neonates <br>were diagnosed with <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. 34 involved the left portal vein and 3 involved <br>more than one vein. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was catheter-associated in 27 (73%) neonates; none <br>of the 5 neonates tested had a pro-thrombotic condition. Of the 37 neonates, <br>12 received <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy and 25 were untreated. The mean <br>follow-up duration was 15.5 months; 19% were followed for >2 years. On last <br>diagnostic imaging, thrombus resolution was documented in treated (n=12) and <br>non-treated (n=25) neonates: 5 (42%) and 14 (56%) complete, 0 and 2 (8%) <br>partial, and 7 (58%) and 9 (36%) stable, respectively. No complications were <br>detected in 32 (86%) neonates, while 2 had hepatomegaly, 2 had abnormal <br>liver enzymes and 1 had splenomegaly and abnormal liver enzymes. (Table <br>presented) Conclusions In our cohort, the <span style="color: red">PVT</span> resolution rate was similar to <br>previously reported studies. Although a low complication rate was detected, <br>longer follow-up is necessary to determine the exact incidence of outcomes <br>such as portal hypertension.<br><br>RECORD 129<br>Direct intrahepatic portocaval shunt for treatment of portal thrombosis and <br>Budd-Chiari syndrome<br>Pedersen M.R.

Data <br>on the long term sequelae of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in paediatric and adolescent patients is <br>limited. Methods Patients included had a diagnosis of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> from Jan 2000- Dec <br>2014. Data collection included patient demographics, aetiologies, <br>presentation and initial treatment of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Data was also collected on <br>further variceal bleeds, shunt surgery, liver transplantation and long term <br>mortality. Results 123 patients (63 male) were identified. Median age at <br>first presentation was 5years 9 months (range 2 days to 25 years). Overall <br>survival was 95.9, 94.3 and 93.5% at 1, 10 and >20 years from <span style="color: red">PVT</span> diagnosis, <br>respectively. Median age at follow up was 13years 3 months (range 6 months <br>to 33 years 2 months). In the majority of cases (52%) no cause for <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was <br>identified. 78% of patients had extrahepatic <span style="color: red">PVT</span> (EH<span style="color: red">PVT</span>), with no extension <br>in to the superior mesenteric vein. 19 patients (15.4%) were anticoagulated <br>or had received a course of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy. Initial presentation <br>was usually due to oesophageal variceal bleeding (52.8%) of which 24 <br>patients had further variceal bleeds (18.7%, oesophageal/ duodenal/rectal). <br>At follow up, 26% of patients (N = 32) were on a beta blocker. Of these, 10 <br>patients (31.3%) had further variceal bleeds versus 14/77 patients, not on a <br>beta blocker (18.2%, p = 0.07). Portal biliopathy was also present in 17.9% <br>(N = 22) as was splenomegaly (82.9%). Ascites and hepatic encephalopathy <br>were uncommon (<7%). 18 patients had shunt surgery, majority of which were <br>meso-caval Rex, of which 7/18 (38.8%) had further variceal bleeds. Two <br>patients underwent transplantation, one of which was for variceal bleeding. <br>Overall mortality in this group of patient with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was low (6.5% N = 8) <br>though only 2 of these patients had a previous history of recurrent variceal <br>bleeds. Conclusion Oesophageal variceal bleeding is a common index <br>presentation of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in paediatric and adolescent patients. Approximately 20% <br>of patients will go on to have further variceal bleeds despite medical <br>intervention. Beta blocker use is associated with recurrent variceal <br>bleeding which may suggest that it is ineffective in preventing further <br>variceal bleeding in patients with established portal cavernomas.

Baranès L. Languille L. Limal N. Loustau V. Bierling <br>P. Michel M. Godeau B. Mahévas M.<br>Blood (2015) 126:23 (3483). Date of Publication: 3 Dec 2015<br><br>Introduction Portal and/or splenic vein thrombosis (PVST), stemming from <br>immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA) or <br>other splenic diseases, is highly associated with splenectomy complications. <br>Although symptomatic PVST is a rare event (incidence rate 1-3%) reportedly <br>associated to mortality, it has been shown through systematic computed <br>tomography (CT) scans that PSVT events exist in up to 50% of splenectomized <br>patients. The clinical significance of this finding remains unclear. <br>Indications of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> depend on the site and extent of PSVT. The <br>relevance of postoperative CT scanning is discussed, specifically in the <br>context of immune cytopenia, where PSVT seems to be less frequent and less <br>extended. We conducted a retrospective study to assess the incidence, the <br>sites and the outcome of PSVT in ITP and wAIHA patients. Patients and <br>methods The study was conducted between 2009 and April 2015 in a <br>tertiary-care center for immune cytopenias (Henri Mondor Hospital, France) <br>where postoperative CT scans are systematically performed. We analyzed <br>splenectomized ITP or wAIHA (without underlying malignancy) adult patients <br>undergoing a postoperative enhanced abdominal CT scan. Clinical and <br>biological data were collected from medical records. All CT scans were <br>reviewed by a senior radiologist using a standardized form. Results Thirty <br>nine patients (19 men, 20 women), with a mean age of 45 years (range, <br>19-83), were splenectomized mostly by laparoscopic surgery (n=38), for ITP <br>(n=30) or wAIHA (n=9). Thirty six patients (92%) had received a preventive <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> treatment for a median duration of 24 post-operative days <br>(range, 7-36). Among ITP patients, the mean preoperative platelet count was <br>95.6 G/L (SD: 97). ITP patients had received corticosteroids (75%), <br>intravenous immunoglobins (43%), or thrombopoietin receptor agonists (41%) <br>in preparation for splenectomy). The overall initial response rate at 2 <br>months from splenectomy was 69% (ITP: 63%, wAIHA: 89 %). The CT scan was <br>performed within 5 days on average (range: 3-12) of splenectomy. The <br>incidence rate of PSVT was 74% (29/39), without discrimination between ITP <br>(22/30, 73%) and wAIHA (7/9, 78%, p = 0.79) (Table 1). There were mostly <br>distal splenic vein (dSVT) (n=14), or dSVT associated with intrahepatic <br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (i<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) (n=12). There were no mesenteric vein <br>thromboses, 1 extrahepatic portal vein (e<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) and 1 proximal splenic vein <br>thrombosis (pSVT). Most of the patients were asymptomatic (n=18). No <br>significant association between PSVT and any clinical or biological <br>characteristics such as platelet count, preoperative treatments, <br>thrombocytosis, or efficacy of splenectomy was observed. However, PSVT <br>patients tended to have higher spleen weights (206 g vs 102 g, p = 0.14). <br>Thirteen of the 29 patients with a PVST were treated with a curative <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> treatment for a mean duration of 11 weeks (range, 4-37). <br>Among the 26 patients evaluable in follow-up, the rate of complete <br>thrombosis resolution was 84% (21/26); specifically, 62% (8/13) in <br>anticoagulated patients and 100% in the 13 non anticoagulated patients (9 <br>dSVT, 4 i<span style="color: red">PVT</span>+dSVT). A portal cavernoma occurred after i<span style="color: red">PVT</span>+dSVT despite <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in the context of wAIHA. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> complications <br>included abdominal wall hematoma requiring transfusions (n=1) and iron <br>deficiency anemia (n=1). Conclusion In our study, post-splenectomy PSVT was <br>frequent and often asymptomatic, involving mostly intrahepatic portal or <br>distal splenic veins and was resolved in half of the cases without any <br>curative anticoagulative therapy. Our results suggest that a systematic <br>screening of PSVT by CT scan should not be performed in absence of risk <br>factors for thrombosis.

Results of a survey of physicians in Australia<br>Szer J. Forsyth C.J. Giese A.<br>Blood (2015) 126:23 (4537). Date of Publication: 3 Dec 2015<br><br>Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare and life-threatening <br>hematopoietic stem cell disorder characterized by uncontrolled <br>complement-mediated hemolysis. Patients with PNH are at increased risk of <br>thromboembolism and premature death. This risk is predominantly due to the <br>effects of chronic hemolysis and platelet activation. Eculizumab, a <br>monoclonal antibody that inhibits terminal complement activation, has been <br>shown to reduce hemolysis and dramatically reduce the rate of <br>thromboembolism. A previous publication (Kelly et al, 2011) suggested that <br>cessation of therapeutic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> (TAC) in PNH patients on eculizumab <br>with no prior history of thrombosis is safe. There are very few reports on <br>the outcomes of cessation of TAC in PNH patients on eculizumab who have a <br>prior history of thrombosis or on the use of non-vitamin K antagonist oral <br>anticoagulant (NOAC) agents in PNH patients with a history of thrombosis. In <br>Australia, patients with PNH are predominantly managed by individual <br>hematologists rather than at a single centre and hence <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>practices following the introduction of eculizumab therapy are variable. We <br>surveyed Australian hematologists managing eculizumab-treated patients with <br>PNH to obtain the details of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> management and incidence of <br>thrombotic events in their patients. We received responses from 30 <br>hematologists caring for a total of 58 patients with PNH on eculizumab (1-17 <br>patients per hematologist) and the table summarises the results. TAC as <br>primary prophylaxis had been ceased in 10 patients with no recurrent <br>thrombotic events. One (1) patient remains on primary prophylaxis due to <br>persistently high D-dimer and factor VIII levels. TAC for secondary <br>prophylaxis had been ceased in 2 patients due to bleeding (1 patient with <br>subdural hematoma, 1 patient with gastrointestinal bleeding) and neither of <br>these patients had a further thrombotic event. One patient, with a prior <br>history of thrombosis, requested cessation of TAC and subsequently developed <br>a provoked thrombosis. Three patients not receiving TAC when eculizumab was <br>commenced developed thrombosis; two (2) patients had provoked deep venous <br>thromboses and one patient developed a splanchnic vein thrombosis following <br>a cholecystectomy in association with severe sepsis. One patient had a <br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> immediately prior to commencing eculizumab therapy <br>but has never received TAC due to severe coexistent thrombocytopenia from <br>myelodysplasia. This patient has not had a recurrent thrombosis. Three (3) <br>patients with thrombotic events prior to eculizumab therapy (1 patient with <br>pulmonary emboli, 1 patient with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and 1 <br>patient with inferior vena cava thrombosis) had anticoagulant therapy <br>changed from warfarin to rivaroxaban. At a follow-up of at least twelve <br>months for all 3 patients there have been no recurrent thrombotic events and <br>no bleeding complications. In conclusion, these Australian data are <br>consistent with those reported by Kelly suggesting that cessation of primary <br>prophylaxis in PNH patients on eculizumab is safe. Cessation of TAC in PNH <br>patients on eculizumab with a prior thrombosis can be considered if there <br>are clear contraindications to <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. Thromboprophylaxis in <br>situations of increased risk of venous thromboembolism remains essential for <br>all PNH patients not on TAC, even when they are on eculizumab therapy. The <br>three patients on rivaroxaban as secondary prophylaxis are, to our <br>knowledge, the first reported patients with PNH treated on a NOAC.

Martinez F.J.R. Constantin E.M. Morales M.G. Jurado M.<br>Blood (2015) 126:23 (4735). Date of Publication: 3 Dec 2015<br><br>OBJECTIVES The low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) are typically <br>administered at fixed doses like thromboprophylaxis or at doses adjusted to <br>the weight of the patient in order to obtain a therapeutic effect. Generally <br>they do not require laboratory monitoring, although it could be considered <br>in special situations (renal failure, extreme weights, pregnant women). The <br>LMWH do not affect the APTT, so it has been proposed to determine the <br>anti-factor Xa activity when it is necessary to monitor its effect. The <br>anti-factor Xa activity should be determined approximately 4 hours after sc <br>administration of the LMWH that it is employed, concurring with the peak of <br>activity. The therapeutic range of the anti-factor Xa activity is between <br>0.6 and 1 IU / mL when LMWH is administered every 12 hours. At single daily <br>dose is less clear, although it seems that lies above 1 IU / mL. Nowadays, <br>LMWH are the anticoagulant of choice during pregnancy. Numerous in vitro and <br>in vivo studies have shown the existence of an antineoplastic effect of <br>heparin. LMWH is commonly used for prolonged treatment of thrombosis <br>associated with cancer. METHODS The main aim of our study is to evaluate the <br>efficacy of tinzaparin sodium at therapeutic doses in preventing VTE in <br>renal failure, active cancer and/or patients with contraindications to oral <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. The dose has been therapeutic and adjusting it has been <br>made in terms of anti-factor Xa levels obtained monthly. Hemorrhagic or <br>thrombotic complications and other possible side effects have been assessed. <br>Until now, a total of 70 patients, 42 men and 28 women aged between 30 and <br>95 years old, have received tinzaparin sodium treatment. The main reason of <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> are: atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter (with or without <br>valve disease), VTE (with or without thrombophilia), stroke and transient <br>ischemic attacks and mechanical prosthetic aortic and mitral valves (some of <br>the patients carrying a double metal prosthesis). There was 1 resistance and <br>1 allergic reaction to anti-vitamin K. 4 of the patients were pregnant and <br>14 had renal failure. Prior to initiation of therapy, analytical <br>determinations were performed, including: blood count, blood coagulation and <br>biochemistry to assess renal function (urea and creatinine). 20 patients (14 <br>were anticoagulated by atrial fibrillation, 2 for bearing a mechanical <br>aortic prosthesis and 4 because of DVT, 1 of which had also a TEP) had <br>active cancer or were in remission from their neoplasia (3 multiple myeloma, <br>1 LAM, 1 CMML, 4 renal tumors, 1 lung cancer, 5 prostate cancers, 1 <br>hepatocellular carcinoma, 2 colon cancer, 1 endometrial adenocarcinoma and 1 <br>retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma). 1 with MDS was treated with LMWH because he <br>had intra- and extrahepatic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. RESULTS Some of the <br>patients had received prior treatment with anti-vitamin K (INR objective <br>depending on pathology) but, in other cases, the low molecular weight <br>heparin was the only treatment since the beginning of their <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. <br>All the patients had received 175 IU / Kg of Tinzaparin Sodium once a day as <br>initial dose, then the dose was adjusted according to the anti-factor Xa <br>levels. They were controlled until 31/07/2015. In terms of side effects, 8 <br>patients presented complications: 3 mucosal bleeding, 2 episodes of stroke <br>in a patient, hemoptysis, deep vein thrombosis and 2 bleeding at the <br>puncture site of heparin, which have not required discontinuation of <br>therapy. When these complications occurred, we proceeded to the <br>corresponding heparin dose adjustment based on new determinations of <br>anti-factor Xa. CONCLUSIONS Although only in 70 cases, the results obtained <br>confirm the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of the continuous use of <br>LMWH. Determination of anti-factor Xa levels are considered very useful for <br>dose adjustment parameter. In our study, tinzaparin sodium has proved to be <br>very useful in preventing venous thromboembolism associated or not with <br>cancer, in patients with conditions requiring <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> and presenting <br>contraindications to the use of anti-vitamin K. The results obtained have <br>demonstrated that tinzaparin is safe and, most likely, further studies will <br>provide valuable confirmation data to support the use of low molecular <br>weight heparins in the prolonged treatment of patients who require oral <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> and can not receive it.<br><br>RECORD 134<br>Ten years of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) in melbourne, australia: Male <br>gender and presence of myeloproliferative neoplasm is associated with <br>thrombotic recurrence in unprovoked events<br>Lim H.Y.

Date of Publication: 3 Dec 2015<br><br>Aim Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) accounts for 0.5-1.0% of all strokes <br>and is a common cause of stroke in young people. The presentations are often <br>heterogeneous and can be associated with significant morbidity and <br>mortality. This review aims to evaluate our local experience in CVT compared <br>to other venous thromboembolism (VTE) with a focus on risk factors for <br>thrombotic recurrence. Methods Retrospective evaluation of consecutive CVT <br>presentations from January 2005 to June 2015, at two major tertiary <br>hospitals in Melbourne, Australia. Data collected included demographics, <br>risk factors, management, complications, modified Rankin score (mRS) and <br>mortality. Results 52 patients (31 female, 21 male) with median age 9.5 <br>(18-83) years, including 4 with cancer, presented with 53 episodes of CVT. <br>Females were younger (32 vs 41 years, p=0.06). Typical presenting symptoms <br>were headache (87%), nausea/vomiting (43%), visual disturbances (38%), focal <br>neurological deficits (28%) and seizures (17%). All but one case was <br>symptomatic, with 53% reporting symptoms in the preceding week. 18 (34%) <br>failed to be diagnosed on initial presentation while 35% (13/37) of CT brain <br>yielded false negative for thrombosis; all of which were subsequently <br>diagnosed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or CT angiography/venography. <br>Commonly thrombosed sinuses included transverse/sigmoid (40%), superior <br>sagittal (11%) or both (43%), with no location-dependent outcome <br>differences. Nine (17%) had CVT-related haemorrhagic transformation and was <br>associated with CVT-related death (2/9 vs 0/44; p=0.04). 28 episodes were <br>provoked - twice more common in female (p=0.02) with 45% attributed to oral <br>contraceptive pill(OCP). 44 patients (85%) had thrombophilia screen <br>performed with 21% positivity. Median duration of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was 6.5 <br>months (8 remained on long-term); 78% treated with warfarin. Eight (15%) <br>required intensive care support, while 2 patients required decompressive <br>surgery. 12 (23%) were not followed up in our institutions. At last <br>follow-up of the remaining 40, 2 (5%) had worsening mRS of 3 2 compared to <br>premorbid, 2 had CVT-related deaths and 2 succumbed to malignancy. 30% <br>reported ongoing symptoms such as headaches, residual neurological deficits, <br>seizures and memory impairment. There were three clot recurrences (1 CVT, 2 <br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>) - all male with initial unprovoked events and were <br>subsequently diagnosed with myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). Of the 3, one <br>was positive for JAK2V617F mutation. Men with unprovoked CVT had a 20% risk <br>of recurrence, significantly higher compared to women with unprovoked events <br>(3/15 vs 0/10; p=0.02). Clot progression, defined as increased clot burden <br>on repeat imaging, occurred in 2 patients - one was associated with MPN <br>while another progressed in the setting of subtherapeutic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>post partum. There was one episode of Grade III bleeding (following a <br>procedure) in addition to the 2 (4%) clot-related deaths discussed prior. <br>Conclusions CVT is rare and may be missed on initial presentation (34%)-with <br>a high degree of clinical suspicion required to improve detection rate. <br>Given there was 35% of CT brain had false negative, MRI or CT angiography is <br>the preferred modality of investigation. It is more common in young people, <br>particularly females on OCP. The presence of haemorrhagic transformation was <br>associated with higher mortality. All thrombotic recurrences in this audit <br>occurred in men with unprovoked events, who were subsequently diagnosed with <br>MPN. This suggests the need for further evaluation, particularly for MPN in <br>males with unprovoked events.

The aim of this single-center, retrospective <br>cohort study was to investigate the incidence of SVT and to determine the <br>connected risk factors. Methods: All consecutive patients with acute <br>pancreatitis (AP) managed in our hospital were included. The primary outcome <br>was the occurrence of SVT and data was collected in accordance with Ranson's <br>criteria. Results: A total of 318 patients were included, of whom 124 <br>(39.0%) were women. Biliary lithiasis was the main cause of pancreatitis <br>(n=156, 49.1%). A total of 19 (6.0%) SVT were identified. In univariate <br>analysis, alcohol intake, smoking and male gender were associated with SVT <br>(P = 0.005, 0.003 and 0.007, respectively). Biological parameters <br>significantly associated with thrombosis were lactate dehydrogenase <br>(LDH)<500 U/L and hyperglycemia (≥10 mmol/L) (P=0.009 and 0.016, <br>respectively). In multivariate analysis, prothrombin time>75% was a <br>protective factor against thrombosis (OR 0.148, P=0.019). Leukocytes <br>>10×10(9)/L (OR 6.397, P=0.034), hyperglycemia (≥10mmol/L) (OR 6.845, <br>P=0.023), LDH<500 U/L ((OR 22.61, P=0.001) and alcoholic etiology (OR 8.960, <br>P =0.041) were risk factors for SVT. Conclusions: Alcohol intake, male <br>gender and smoking should focus the physician's attention on the risk of <br>SVT. When further associated with certain biological parameters, the <br>physicians should consider therapeutic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> to prevent SVT.<br><br>RECORD 136<br>Outcome of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in patients with cirrhosis and portal vein <br>thrombosis<br>Srijith K. Joseph D. Ramu M. Chethan G. Prasanth T.S. Suraj N. Gopu Sreejaya <br>S. Das K.<br>Indian Journal of Gastroenterology (2015) 34:1 SUPPL. 1 (A36). Date of <br>Publication: November 2015<br><br>Background and Aims: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> is a frequent event seen in <br>patients with cirrhosis and can be treated with anticoagulants. There are <br>limited data regarding its safety in patients with cirrhosis. We <br>retrospectively analyzed this treatment approach in patients with cirrhosis <br>and <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. Methods: We analyzed data of 45 patients with <br>cirrhosis and <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> diagnosed in between the period January <br>2011 to December 2014 who presented to our Department of Medical <br>Gastroenterology, Govt. Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram. Portal vein <br>thrombosis was diagnosed and recanalization was evaluated by using Doppler <br>ultrasound and CECT abdomen (hepatic protocol). Results: Partial or complete <br>recanalization was achieved in 22 patients (48.88 %). The factor <br>significantly associated with recanalization was early initiation of <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. Patients with recanalization had less frequent <br>complications such as portal hypertension related bleeding, ascites and <br>hepatic encephalopathy during the follow up period. Four patients developed <br>bleeding complications. The patients who developed bleeding complications <br>were Child C and had had a platelet count less than 50,000. Two deaths were <br>reported related to bleeding complications related to <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>therapy. Conclusions: <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> is a relatively safe treatment that <br>leads to partial or complete recanalization of the portal vein in about 49 % <br>of patients with cirrhosis and <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Bleeding complications though infrequent <br>may be related to low platelet count.<br><br>RECORD 137<br>Cutaneous thrombosis as the presenting finding of paroxysmal nocturnal <br>haemoglobinuria<br>Salim O.

Ohlsson H. Sundquist J. Sundquist K.<br>Thrombosis Journal (2015) 13:1 Article Number: 34. Date of Publication: 21 <br>Oct 2015<br><br>Background: The aim was to assess the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) <br>associated with use of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) in women with a <br>family history of VTE. Methods: The study is a Swedish nationwide <br>case-control study based on the Multigeneration register, the Swedish <br>Hospital Discharge Register, the Outpatient Care Register, and the Swedish <br>Prescribed Drug Register. Cases (n = 2,311) were non-pregnant Swedish women <br>aged 15-49 with first VTE diagnoses between January 2006 and December 2010. <br>Five controls without VTE were matched to each case on age and education <br>level. Conditional logistic regression examined the associations with VTE <br>with determination of odds ratio (OR) for first VTE diagnosis. Effect <br>modification was assessed by interaction testing. Results: Both among <br>controls (14.6 % vs. 4.5 %; p < 0.0001) and cases (27.2 % vs. 8.8 %; p < <br>0.0001) COC use was more common in women without a family history of VTE <br>compared with women with a family history of VTE. In a multivariate <br>conditional logistic regression model the OR for VTE was 2.53 (95 % CI <br>2.23-2.87) for COC users and 2.38 (2.09-2.71) for individuals with a family <br>history of VTE. The OR for VTE for COC users with a family history of VTE <br>was 6.02 (5.02-7.22). There was no significant interaction between family <br>history of VTE and COC use (OR 0.92, 0.57-1.46). Conclusions: Family history <br>of VTE is a risk factor for VTE in women using COCs. The low prevalence of <br>COC use among women with a family history of VTE suggests that family <br>history of VTE is considered when COCs are prescribed in Sweden. The present <br>study may therefore even underestimate the importance of family history of <br>VTE. The lack of interaction indicates that the risk of COC use in women <br>with family history of VTE is determined by the product of the ORs for <br>family history and COC use.<br><br>RECORD 139<br>Impact of regional vein thrombosis in patients with Klebsiella pneumoniae <br>liver abscess<br>Molton J.S.

A recent <br>study showed that prophylactic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> prevented portal vein <br>thrombosis (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) and decreased episodes of decompensation of cirrhosis. <br>Aims: To analyze the effect of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> on recanalization of <br>non-tumoral <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in patients with cirrhosis and its effect on prognosis. <br>Methods: 69 consecutive patients with cirrhosis diagnosed with non-tumoral <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span> were studied. The clinical features at diagnosis of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and factors <br>associated with <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> use were studied. Decision to start <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was taken at the discretion of the clinician managing the <br>patient. The effect of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> on <span style="color: red">PVT</span> recanalization and mortality <br>was analyzed. Results: The average age was 58.6±11.8 years and 44(64%) were <br>males. Severity of cirrhosis: Median(Range) Child-Pugh(CP) score: 8(5-15), <br>MELD score:13(6-35). CP class: A-15(22%), B-32(46%), C-22(32%). At diagnosis <br>of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, 55(80%) were symptomatic. Variceal bleeding(VB) in 30(46%) and <br>abdominal pain in 19(29%) were the main clinical presentations. <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> (LMWH-9, warfarin-16) was administered in 25(36%) patients <br>one of whom with cavernoma. Patients with VB were less likely to be given <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> (p=0.037). There were no differences in age, gender, <br>etiology, severity of cirrhosis and extent of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in patients receiving, or <br>not, <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. Recanalization of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was assessed by at least one <br>imaging study in 60 patients and recanalization (Total-13, partial - 9) of <br>the portal vein was documented in 22(37%) patients. Median (Range) follow-up <br>was 21(0-376) months. At the end of follow-up, 29(42%) patients died, of <br>which sixteen deaths were related to infectious complications with no deaths <br>due to <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> related bleeding. By Cox regression analysis, factors <br>associated with mortality at the end of follow-up were: Age (HR 1.040, 95% <br>C.I. 1.002-1.078, p=0.037), CP score (HR 1.35, 95% C.I. 1.18-1.55, <br>p<0.001),MELD score (HR 1.14, 95% C.I. 1.08-1.21, p<0.001), creatinine <br>(HR1.52, 95% C.I. 1.06-2.16, p=0.021). <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> significantly <br>decreased mortality at the end of follow-up even after adjusting for VB at <br>diagnosis of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> (HR 0.30 95% C.I.0.11-0.82, p=0.019). KM survival analysis <br>confirmed that patients with cirrhosis and <span style="color: red">PVT</span> given <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> had <br>better outcome compared to those not given <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>(p=0.025) Portal <br>vein recanalization was more frequent in patients on <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> than no <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> (61% vs 22%) (p=0.005). Conclusions: <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in <br>patients with cirrhosis and <span style="color: red">PVT</span> seems to be safe and associated with higher <br>portal vein recanalization rates and significantly lower mortality.<br><br>RECORD 141<br>Pylephlebitis: A case of suppurative thrombophlebitis of the portal system<br>Achdjian H.S. Scherback D. Young M.<br>American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015) 110 SUPPL. 1 (S315-S316). Date <br>of Publication: October 2015<br><br>Pylephlebitis is a suppurative thrombophlebitis of the portal system, a rare <br>complication of an intraabdominal infection with severe and life-threatening <br>illness. Nonspecific clinical findings make the diagnosis of pylephlebitis <br>challenging. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be started immediately. <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> is considered case-by-case basis. A 67-year-old Caucasian <br>male with minimal past medical history presented with a two week duration of <br>diffuse abdominal pain associated with fevers, chills and generalized <br>fatigue. On admission, he was febrile to 103oF, abdomen was soft, mildly <br>tender to palpation in the right upper quadrant and epigastrium, and bowel <br>sounds were normal. WBC 10.8, AST 42, ALT 43. Hypercoagulable workup was <br>negative. CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast showed thrombosis of the left <br>portal, superior mesenteric and the inferior mesenteric veins. PET scan <br>demonstrated metabolic activity in the left lobe of the liver, corresponding <br>to the course of thrombosed left portal vein. Colonoscopy revealed terminal <br>ileum with mucosal changes with blue discoloration, representing vascular <br>congestion from thrombosis. Patient was started on pipercillin/tazobactam <br>upon admission. Blood cultures subsequently grew Bacteroides fragilis. <br>Patient was discharged home on enoxaparin as a bridge to warfarin for <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, completed a twenty-six day course of moxifloxacin and was <br>doing well on follow-up three months later. Pylephlebitis occurs secondary <br>to intra-abdominal infection; most commonly from acute colonic <br>diverticulitis, appendicitis, inflammatory bowel disease, suppurative <br>pancreatitis or bowel perforation. It is a polymicrobial infection with <br>Bacteroides fragilis being the most common isolate. The clinical <br>presentation is often vague and nonspecific with symptoms of non-localizing <br>abdominal pain, fever, fatigue, nausea and vomiting. Laboratory findings <br>include leukocytosis, elevation of AST and/or ALT, an increase of ALP and/or <br>GGT. Positive blood cultures are found in 55-88% of patients. The diagnosis <br>is ultimately based on an abdominal source of infection along with imaging <br>demonstrating portal vein thrombus. An abdominal CT with oral and IV <br>contrast is the modality most widely used. When suspected, broadspectrum <br>antibiotics should be started immediately. Parenteral antibiotics are <br>administered for the first 1-3 weeks until clinical improvement is noted and <br>subsequently transitioned to oral antibiotics. The role of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>in pylephlebitis has not been well established and remains controversial, <br>yet useful in mesenteric vein thrombosis, in patients with hypercoagulable <br>states and in infection with Bacteroides species. Pylephlebitis mortality <br>rate is 25% and is more likely secondary to severe sepsis leading to bowel <br>infarction.

Jodorkovsky D.<br>American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015) 110 SUPPL. 1 (S448-S449). Date <br>of Publication: October 2015<br><br>Introduction: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) can cause complications such as <br>ascites, diarrhea, ileus, transient moderate elevation in serum <br>aminotransferases and even intestinal ischemia from clot extension into <br>mesenteric veins. Here, we describe a case of persistent ileus resulting <br>from <span style="color: red">PVT</span> after cholecystectomy. Case presentation: 72 year-old male with <br>DM-2 was diagnosed with choledocholithiasis and biliary pancreatitis two <br>weeks prior for which he underwent endoscopic retrograde <br>cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with stone extraction. Subsequently, he was <br>taken for laparoscopic cholecystectomy which was converted into open <br>cholecystectomy due to portal vein damage which was immediately repaired. He <br>then developed small bowel ileus, persistent nasogastric tube drainage and <br>non-bloody diarrhea. The JP drain had persistent output as high as 1 <br>liter/day. A HIDA scan ruled out bile leak and an ultrasound with doppler <br>ruled out thrombosis. He was subsequently transferred to our medical center. <br>On examination, abdomen was soft , moderately distended, diffusely tender <br>and an indwelling JP drain in RUQ was draining serous fluid. The fluid <br>analysis was not suggestive of bile leak (fluid total bilirubin = 0.4 mg/dL, <br>serum bilirubin = 1 mg/dL) and SAAG ratio was 2.2 (fluid albumin = 0.7 g/dL, <br>serum albumin = 2.9 g/dL), consistent with portal hypertension. An <br>ultrasound with doppler study showed patent portal veins with slow flow. A <br>CT scan with contrast showed a non-occlusive thrombus involving the <br>extrahepatic main portal vein, obstructing >75% lumen, superior and inferior <br>mesenteric venous thrombosis, and ascites. Over course of next few days <br>after patient was started on <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, the ileus resolved and JP <br>drain output decreased gradually. Patient was able to advance his diet and <br>was discharged home. Discussion: The major risk factors for <span style="color: red">PVT</span> include <br>cancer of any abdominal organ, focal inflammatory lesions (e.g. <br>pancreatitis, cholecystitis, duodenal ulcer), portal vein injury and <br>cirrhosis. Several factors particular to laparoscopic procedures such as <br>venous stasis, alteration in coagulation parameters as a result of <br>pneumoperitoneum and damage of splanchnic endothelium by surgical <br>manipulation also play a role. The portal vein is much less vulnerable to <br>injury in cholecystectomy than the right hepatic artery, so a high index of <br>suspicion is required for diagnosis. Although ultrasound with doppler is <br>fairly sensitive (89-93%) and specific (92-93%), CT or MR angiography have a <br>higher sensitivity for diagnosing <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. The goal of treatment is to <br>recanalize the obstructed veins, which will prevent hepatic and intestinal <br>infarction and portal hypertension.

Smith Z.<br>American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015) 110 SUPPL. 1 (S305-S306). Date <br>of Publication: October 2015<br><br>Introduction: Although uncommon, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been <br>found to be an independent risk factor for acquired thrombosis, even rarer <br>is <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) as the presenting illness. Case Report: A 28 <br>y/o nonsmoking female presented with 10 days of worsening abdominal pain. In <br>addition, she reported nausea, vomiting, and bloody stools. On PE, she was <br>alert, oriented, afebrile, mild tachycardia, normal blood pressure and <br>generalized abdominal tenderness on deep palpation only. Routine labs <br>indicated mild anemia, normal WBC and platelets, INR of 2.3 and elevated <br>transaminases. Infectious stool evaluation did not reveal C. difficile, <br>Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, E. coli, or Ova/ parasitic infection. <br>However, stool showed increased Lactoferrin. Abdominal imaging revealed <br>acute <span style="color: red">PVT</span> on RUQ ultrasound with Doppler and CT abdomen/pelvis suggested <br>colitis. Hypercoagulable state assessment did not confirm Lupus <br>anticoagulant, Factor V Leiden or prothrombin abnormalities. Colonoscopy <br>revealed hemorrhagic, inflamed and ulcerated mucosa from the rectum to <br>transverse colon; biopsies displayed an interstitial <br>neutrophilic/lymphoplasmocytic infiltrate with surface ulceration, cryptitis <br>and crypt abscesses. She was treated simultanously with intravenous <br>methylprednisolone q8 hours and enoxaparin BID for colitis and <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, <br>respectively. Patient responded well to treatment, eventually transitioning <br>to oral prednisone and mesalamine as well as warfarin with resolution of all <br>presenting symptoms. Discussion: Fewer than 10% of IBD patients have an <br>extra intestinal manifestation at initial presentation. These are most <br>commonly sacroilitis, peripheral arthritis, ocular, mucocutaneous and <br>vascular. In one study, thromboembolic complications occurred in 1.3% of IBD <br>patients with majority having deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. In <br>IBD patients, inpatient status and steroid therapy as well as post bowel <br>resection are risk factors for development of porto-mesenteric venous <br>thrombosis. However, acute <span style="color: red">PVT</span> has not been reported as part of an IBD <br>initial presentation previously. Conclusion: <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is very uncommon in <br>patients with IBD, especially at presentation. If present, complete <br>evaluation (including hypercoagulable state assessment, medication history <br>review, smoking status and imaging) should occur. Therapeutic options <br>including <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> or thrombolysis can be used while simultaneously <br>treating the IBD episode.

Barawi M.<br>American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015) 110 SUPPL. 1 (S101). Date of <br>Publication: October 2015<br><br>Introduction: “Pylephlebitis” or infective suppurative thrombosis of the <br>portal vein is a rare condition with a 30-80% mortality rate. Most cases are <br>associated with intra-abdominal sepsis. Diverticulitis and appendicitis are <br>the primary foci in most reported cases. Only 5% of cases are associated <br>with pancreatitis. Case: A 38-year-old African American female with recent <br>history of alcoholic pancreatitis complicated by pseudocyst status post <br>endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with pseudocyst <br>drainage presented with acute abdominal pain, fevers, nausea and vomiting. <br>Physical examination revealed normal heart rate and blood pressure. <br>Abdominal exam was significant for severe epigastric tenderness and palpable <br>liver margin. Laboratory values included WBC 10.5, hematocrit 23.6, lipase <br>31, alkaline phosphatase 144 and normal hepatic transaminases. Contrast <br>enhanced computerized tomography scan of the abdomen showed acute portal <br>vein thrombosis with multiple low-density lesions within the liver <br>suggestive of abscesses. Blood cultures grew the anaerobic bacteria <br>Eubacterium aerofaciens. The diagnosis of infective suppurative thrombosis <br>of the portal vein was rendered. Parenteral antibiotics and <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>were initiated. CT-guided drainage of the largest liver abscess was <br>performed and cultures grew Streptococcus viridans. She showed progressive <br>clinical improvement and she was successfully transitioned to outpatient <br>care. Discussion: Portal vein pylephlebitis is very rare and usually <br>presents with nonspecific clinical and laboratory findings. Pancreatitis is <br>an uncommon etiology. Hepatic abscesses can complicate severe cases. The <br>prothrombotic effect of the underlying infectious or inflammatory process is <br>the main proposed mechanism.

Mehta D. Sharma N. Agarwal A. Haq K.F. Kassab M. Sule S. Wolf D.C.<br>American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015) 110 SUPPL. 1 (S460). Date of <br>Publication: October 2015<br><br>Introduction: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is a known common complication of <br>umbilical vein catheterization. However, most cases resolve spontaneously. <br>We report a case of a patient with chronic <span style="color: red">PVT</span> secondary to umbilical vein <br>catheterization - managed with mesocaval shunt surgery - who subsequently <br>presented with shunt thrombosis and intestinal ischemia. Case Summary: A 34 <br>year old woman with a history of a mesocaval shunt presented with severe <br>abdominal pain that was attributed to intestinal ischemia. The patient was <br>born prematurely at 25 weeks of gestation. She underwent umbilical vein <br>catheterization as a neonate. At age 1, she presented with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and variceal <br>bleeding. This was managed with splenic artery embolization. At age 16, she <br>again presented with variceal bleeding, this time managed by the creation of <br>a mesocaval shunt. At age 34, she experienced the acute onset of severe <br>diffuse abdominal pain and melena. There was severe diffuse abdominal <br>tenderness with no rebound. Labs showed Hgb 8.7 gm/dL, platelets 52000/ mcL, <br>normal liver function, INR 1.13. CT angiogram demonstrated extensive <br>intraabdominal varices and occlusion of the mesocaval shunt. Venography <br>demonstrated that the mesocaval shunt was completely thrombosed. Mesocaval <br>shunt dilation was performed with an angioplasty balloon. After balloon <br>deflation, venography showed that both the portal and caval anastomoses were <br>narrowed. A Wallstent prosthesis was placed across both anastomoses, <br>resulting in a functional shunt and decreased hepatopetal flow. Abdominal <br>pain gradually resolved after stent placement. A work-up to rule out a <br>hypercoagulable state was unremarkable. Pan-endoscopy post shunt revision <br>showed no active bleeding, moderate esophageal varices, small gastric and <br>rectal varices and severe portal hypertensive gastropathy. The specific GI <br>bleeding site was not identified. Given patient's history of falls, <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was not begun and the patient was discharged on aspirin and <br>pantoprazole. Plans were made for periodic reassessment of shunt patency. <br>Discussion: Mesocaval shunts undergo thrombosis in about 10% of cases. When <br>they thrombose, subsequent intestinal ischemia is rarely reported. <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> has not been shown to alter the outcome of umbilical vein <br>catheterization-related <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. However, <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> is an important tool <br>for the prevention of recurrent mesenteric venous thrombosis.

Patients with malignant <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, Budd-Chiari syndrome, <br>underlying primary hematologic disorders, were excluded from the analysis. <br>The extension of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> at baseline as well as its evolution on treatment were <br>evaluated by both Doppler ultrasound and CT. At baseline, 31 out of 42 <br>patients (73.8.%) had a platelet count lower than 70.000/ mm3, while 19 <br>(45.23%) had a platelet count < 50.000/ mm3. For <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, the dose <br>of FPX was adjusted on the body weight (BW), and on the trend of platelet <br>count ranging from 2.5 to 7.5 mg/die. Results After a mean period of 16,36 ± <br>13,86 months of treatment, 18 patients (42,86%) showed a complete resolution <br>of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, defined as disappearance of all evidence of thrombosis. Ten patients <br>(23,81%) showed a partial resolution, defined by a decrease ≥ 30% reduction <br>in the main diameter of the main thrombus and/or a decrease ≥ 50% in <br>cross-sectional area without evidence of the appearance of new thrombi. 14 <br>patients (33,33%) showed no response, defined as a decrease in thrombus size <br>that did not qualify for partial resolution, or as a progression of <br>thrombosis or the appearance of new thrombus. One patient developed a <br>non-lethal major bleeding event (haemoperitoneum three day after <br>paracentesis) while 5 patients developed a non-major bleeding events during <br>the study (14.3%). In all these patients but one FPX was discontinued. No <br>significant change was observed in the platelet count during treatment <br>(67.318,18/mm3 ± 36.830,08 mm3 versus 68.255,81/mm3 ± 36.358,72, P = N.S.). <br>Nevertheless, in 6 patients FPX was withdrawn for a worsening of <br>thrombocytopenia (last value during treatment <15.000/mm3). Conclusions In <br>patients with cirrhosis and marked thrombocytopenia, FPX seems to be <br>effective and safe in the treatment of acute nonmalignant <span style="color: red">PVT</span>.<br><br>RECORD 147<br>Use of betablockers, previous hepatic encephalopathy and low albumin levels <br>as risk factors of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in a cohort of cirrhotic patients<br>Gomez M.L.

Date of Publication: <br>October 2015<br><br>Objective: To associate cerebral venous Sinus thrombosis (CVST) in a young <br>male with intake of weight loss pills. Background: 13% of CVST remain <br>idiopathic. Weight loss pills were not reported before as causative agents <br>for CVST. Method: Case report. Description: 34 year old man with focal <br>seizures was diagnosed to have extensive CVST. He took weight loss pills for <br>1 year prior to event. He progressed to status epilepticus despite <br>treatment. MRV brain and angiogram shows the extent of his CVST. <br>Echocardiogram, Venous Duplex of the extremities, hypercoagulable profile <br>were normal. Factor VIII level was elevated. There was no mutation of Factor <br>V or prothrombin gene. He underwent endovascular suction thrombectomy with <br>improvement in his clinical status.

Hirahara K. Sugawara K. Nakayama N. Imai Y. Mochida S.<br>Hepatology (2015) 62 SUPPL. 1 (935A). Date of Publication: October 2015<br><br>Aim: Although <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapies with Xa inhibitors and antithrombin <br>concentrates were shown to be effective for attenuation of portal vein <br>thrombosis in cirrhotic patients, aggravation or recurrence of the lesions <br>may occur following the therapies leading to derangement of liver function. <br>Decrease of blood flow in the portal vein as a consequence of porto-systemic <br>shunts may responsible for thrombosis development. Thus, the usefulness of <br>B-RTO as a consolidation procedure after <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapies was <br>evaluated. Methods: The subjects were 43 patients (23 men and 20 women, aged <br>from 40 to 76 years old) with <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> complicating portal vein <br>thrombosis. Both danaparoid Na (2,500 units/day) and antithrombin <br>concentrates (1,500 units/day) were intravenously administrated for 3 days <br>followed by danaparoid Na injections for further 11 days. Patients seen in <br>April 2013 and later received B-RTO procedures after <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>therapies, when porto-systemic shunts were observed on CT and/or MRI <br>imaging. A balloon catheter was inserted into the shunts followed by <br>injection of 5% ethanolamine oleate through the catheter under balloon <br>inflation. The balloon was kept inflation for 6 to 48 hours depending on <br>sizes of the shunts. Results: Immediately after <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapies, <br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> was completely disappeared in 11 patients (25%) and <br>the sizes of thrombosis were attenuated in 15 patients (35%), while the <br>lesions did not change in 17 patients (40%). B-RTO was additionally done in <br>4 patients; 2 patients showing complete thrombosis disappearance and 2 <br>patients failing to achieve thrombosis attenuation. Following B-RTO <br>procedures, thrombosis did not recur in both of the former patients and the <br>lesions disappeared in both of the latter patients despite that <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapies were ineffective. In contrast, in 39 patients <br>without additional B-RTO procedures, thrombosis recurred in 4 among 9 <br>patients after thrombosis disappearance and was aggravated in 6 among 15 <br>patients achieving thrombosis attenuation. Conclusion: B-RTO was effective <br>as a consolidation procedure after <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapies for patients <br>with <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> even in those failing to achieve attenuation of <br>the lesions when porto-systemic shunts responsible for decrease of blood <br>flows in the portal vein were observed.<br><br>RECORD 151<br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> as a cause of massive ascites in a non-cirrhotic <br>patient<br>Ramirez C.B.

Date of <br>Publication: October 2015<br><br>The prevalence of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) in the general population is <br>< 1%. Predisposing conditions associated <span style="color: red">PVT</span> include cirrhosis, most <br>commonly (up to 35%), hepatobiliary malignancies, abdominal infectious or <br>inflammatory processes, abdominal trauma or myeloproliferative disorders. <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span> in a non-cirrhotic patient is rare and is hypothesized to be secondary <br>to an underlying hypercoagulable state. A 65-year-old male presented with <br>progressive abdominal pain and distention over the past 3 months. He denied <br>any fevers, melena or hematemesis. He consumed 1 pint of vodka daily over <br>the last 5 years. Exam was remarkable for abdominal distention, however, <br>there was no stigmata suggestive of cirrhosis. Labs were significant for <br>hemoglobin 8.2 g/dL, total bilirubin 0.6mg/dl, direct bilirubin 0.4mg/dl, <br>alkaline phosphase 88 U/L, AST 123 U/L and ALT 64 U/L. Hepatitis C antibody <br>was positive with an undetectable viral load. Otherwise, white blood cell <br>count (WBC), platelet count, albumin, BUN/creatinine, coagulation profile, <br>and remaining hepatitis serologies were normal. An abdominal CT was <br>consistent with a large amount of ascites with a normal liver and spleen <br>size and without morphologic changes suggestive of cirrohsis. Hypodensities <br>in the lumen of the main and right portal veins were consistant with thrombi <br>(fig1). Paracentesis was negative for subacute bacterial perotonitis with a <br>calculated SAAG of 2.2 g/dL. Cytology was negative for malignant cells. <br>Hypercoagulable work-up and additional imaging were planned however not <br>completed as that patient left against medical advice. Ascites is a common <br>symptom in patients with portal hypertension secondary to cirrhosis, however <br>in this case, our patient was found to have ascites secondary to <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in the <br>absence of cirrhosis. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> complications include bowel ischemia, portal <br>cholangiopathy, septic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>, and portal hypertension. <br>Management is controversial and typically depends on the acuity of the <br>thrombi. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy is generally warranted. However, mortality <br>rates in <span style="color: red">PVT</span> range from 1-20% with a majority of deaths caused by variceal <br>bleeding. Ascites, in the setting of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is a significant and independent <br>prognostic factor and associated with a decreased long-term survival. It is <br>important to recognize <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> as an alternative etiology of <br>ascites in patients without evidence of cirrhosis, as this can guide further <br>management decisions.

Date of Publication: 2015<br><br>Introduction: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is an extremely rare <br>entity/condition with exact incidence being unknown in patients without <br>cirrhosis. Some of the commonly known causes include cirrhosis, primary or <br>secondary hepatobiliary malignancies, infectious or inflammatory abdominal <br>processes and myeloproliferative disorders. We report the case of an elderly <br>man who presented with idiopathic <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. He rapidly developed encephalopathy <br>requiring admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) followed by multiorgan <br>failure leading to his death. Autopsy revealed diffuse intrahepatic <br>cholangiocarcinoma almost entirely replacing his liver parenchyma. Case <br>Description: A 64 year-old previously healthy male, presented with 4-week <br>history of vague right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Laboratory values <br>showed an elevated alkaline phosphatase (340 IU/L) with other markers of <br>liver function, complete blood count and pancreatic enzymes in the normal <br>range. Imaging studies revealed extensive portal, splenic, superior and <br>inferior mesenteric vein thrombosis with mosaic perfusion and wedge shaped <br>areas of liver infarction (Figure 1a). Extensive work-up failed to reveal <br>any obvious cause for <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Surgical exploration and catheter directed <br>thrombolysis options were not felt to be feasible given the extensive clot <br>burden. The patient was started on <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy. Over the course <br>of next 10 days he continued to deteriorate and developed progressive <br>hepatic encephalopathy with worsening liver function requiring ICU <br>admission. The patient continued to decline and eventually died of <br>multi-organ failure. Autopsy revealed extensive, diffuse intrahepatic <br>cholangiocarcinoma that had almost entirely replaced his normal liver <br>parenchyma (Figure 1b). Figure 1(a): Computed tomograhy of abdomen showing <br>mosaic perfusion and and wedge shaped areas of liver infarction, 1(b): <br>Autopsy showing extensive, diffuse intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma almost <br>entirely replacing normal liver parenchyma. Conclusion: Although known to be <br>one of the common causes of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, underlying hepatobiliary malignancies may <br>sometimes remain undiagnosed therefore needing a high index of suspicion. <br>The imaging findings can mimic liver infarction or be non-diagnostic <br>especially if the underlying malignancy replaces the entire liver <br>parenchyma.

Date of Publication: <br>September 2015<br><br>Portal and/or mesenteric vein thrombosis is detected in up to 28% of <br>cirrhotic patients, with a cumulative incidence of 12.8, 20, and 38.7% at 1, <br>5, and 8-10 years of followup, respectively (1, 2). In contrast to <br>non-cirrhotic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) where coagulation or haematologic <br>disorders play the dominant role, haemodynamic factors, i.e. decelerated <br>blood flow, are of major importance. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in cirrhosis has a negative effect <br>on outcome and transplantation (3), a fact which underlines the importance <br>of a treatment algorithm. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> using low-molecularweight heparin <br>(LMWH) or vitamin K antagonists are effective in the treatment of patients <br>with limited and recent <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, resulting in a recanalization in up to 50% <br>irrespective whether low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or warfarin was <br>given. The efficacy of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> correlated negatively with delayed <br>initiation of treatment (thrombus age) and extension of the thrombus (4). In <br>10% of the patients receiving <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, the thrombus increased during <br>treatment into mesenteric veins (5) with a respective clinical <br>deterioration. Discontinuation of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> results in an early <br>recurrence of 38% (4). Additional issues showing the limitations of <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> are the probably limited compliance of long-term LMWH and <br>the problem with monitoring of vitamin K antagonists (6). In contrast to <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, TIPS corrects the pathophysiology of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> formation by <br>considerably increasing the portal vein flow velocity. It results in a <br>recanalization of 67-100% and reduces the rebleeding rate considerably in <br>patients with chronic <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, including cavernoma (1). The largest study <br>including 70 consecutive patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in cirrhosis found an overall <br>response of 87% with almost complete (>75%) or complete recanalization in <br>81% (7). The rebleeding rates were very low after successful TIPS and <br>differed significantly when compared to patients with unsuccessful <br>intervention (8). Considering the pros and cons regarding <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>and TIPS, the algorithm shown in Figure 1 is suggested. Patients with recent <br>or incomplete <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and limited extension and without symptoms of portal <br>hypertension should receive <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> as primary treatment. TIPS may <br>also be a second-line treatment if patients do not respond to <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> within 3-6 months. In contrast, TIPS may be the first-line <br>treatment when thrombosis is complete, extended, or chronic, when patients <br>have symptomatic portal hypertension (ascites, bleedings) or are candidates <br>for liver transplantation (1). It should be kept in mind that <br>recommendations are preliminary as long as randomized studies are lacking. <br>(figure present).<br><br>RECORD 155<br>Percutaneous treatment options in <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span><br>Krajina A.

Date of Publication: September 2015<br><br>Learning Objectives 1. To describe the indications for acute and chronic <br>portal and mesenteric vein occlusion treatment 2. To outline techniques and <br>devices for recanalising portal and mesenteric vein occlusion 3. To describe <br>the results of thrombectomy, thrombolysis, and mechanical recanalisation The <br>portal vein (PV) is a closed system between two low-pressure capillary <br>networks (1). Its thrombosis mainly occurs not only in patients with liver <br>cirrhosis (2-4) but also in patients without liver disease (5, 6) as a <br>complication of hypercoagulable syndromes, latent or overt <br>myeloproliferalive disorder (7), and inflammatory processes in the abdominal <br>cavity and as a result of iatrogenic injury (8, 9). PV obstruction causes <br>portal hypertension. There are several terms describing various clinical <br>settings in relationship with PV obstruction in the current literature. 1. <br>PV thrombosis in <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> could be caused by impaired blood flow due <br>to intrahepatic sinusoidal block, and it is observed in up to 17% of <br>patients with <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span>, especially in more advanced stages of <br>disease. PV invasion frequently occurs in hepatocellular carcinoma, and it <br>has become one of the most important prognostic factors for this disease <br>(10). 2. Extrahepatic PV obstruction (EHPVO) is a vascular disorder of the <br>liver. It is defined by the obstruction of the extra-hepatic PV with or <br>without the involvement of intra-hepatic PV branches or splenic or superior <br>mesenteric veins. 3. Isolated occlusion of the splenic vein caused by <br>pancreatitis and/or external compression or infiltration by pancreatic <br>tumorous expansion or tumors. 4. Acute PV thrombosis nonspecifically <br>presents with abdominal pain, fever, and nausea. Majority of patients have <br>splenomegaly. In contrast to the Budd-Chiari syndrome, ascites are rarely <br>present. The most significant complication is venous bowel ischemia due to <br>the extension of thrombosis to mesenteric veins (11). 5. Chronic PV <br>thrombosis has a variety of clinical presentations. Majority of patients <br>could be asymptomatic, and PV chronic thrombosis is an incidental finding. <br>This can be explained by two compensatory mechanisms. There is compensatory <br>increase of arterial blood flow in the hepatic artery and fast development <br>of the collateral venous network bypassing the obstruction. Due to this <br>compensatory arterial and venous blood flow, there is no or minimal <br>reduction of blood inflow to the liver. However, portal hypertension <br>develops with bleeding from gastroesophageal varices and portal gastropathy. <br>There is a 12% risk of bleeding per year; higher risk is observed in <br>patients with larger varices and previous history of bleeding. Portal <br>biliopathy is another possible complication of chronic PV obstruction. It <br>results from the obstruction of bile ducts by ectatic venous collaterals in <br>their wall. There is a risk of extension of thrombosis to mesenteric veins <br>with bowel ischemia (6). Percutaneous recanalization of acute PV thrombosis <br>significantly differs from chronic PV occlusion in indications, technique, <br>technical results, clinical outcome, and complications. Partial or complete <br>acute PV thrombosis, which arises frequently as an urgent indication for <br>TIPS because of endoscopically uncontrolled variceal bleeding, does not <br>change the usual technique of TIPS. Released thrombi in the PV can cause <br>obstruction of the new shunt and have to be mechanically removed. As soon as <br>sufficient flow is established, remaining thrombi in the PV will dissolve <br>with time. TIPS is technically difficult in chronic EHPVO, and its <br>indication depends on the patency of some intrahepatic PV branches and on <br>the extension of chronic thrombosis towards splenic and/or mesenteric veins. <br>Technical success depends on the possibility to cross chronic vein <br>obstruction with hydrophilic guidewire (12-15). Isolated splenic vein <br>occlusion is usually indicated to splenectomy and/or surgical porto-systemic <br>bypass. However, endovascular recanalization via transjugular or <br>trans-splenic approach is feasible (16). Percutaneous endovascular <br>procedures are used as an alternative to sclerotherapy or surgical shunting <br>in order to improve clinical symptoms. Their main role is to debulk the <br>thrombus by means of mechanical thrombectomy or pharmacological thrombolysis <br>alone or by blood flow facilitation using TIPS (1,17,18). Techniques of <br>portal vein recanalization The crucial imaging modality is contrast-enhanced <br>CT, which demonstrates patency of intrahepatic portal branches, splenic, <br>mesenteric, and hepatic veins, and the inferior vena cava, and extension of <br>the thrombus towards feeders of the PV. Our primary approach is a <br>transjugular one for the portal vein access using Rosch-Uchida set (Cook <br>Inc., USA) and 180-cm angled tip hydrophilic guidewire (Terumo, Japan). As <br>soon as the guidewire is safely in the PV, TIPS is performed using bare <br>stent. Through this approach, we utilize various mechanical devices to <br>fragment and aspirate the thrombus (Arrow-Trerotola Over-The-Wire PTD Kit; <br>Arrow International, Inc.). As soon as the blood flow is reestablished, we <br>wait for at least 10 minutes for any sign of recurrent thrombosis or flow <br>impairment. Acute and subacute thrombus is soft and easy to cross with <br>hydrophilic guidewire. In case blood flow is not established, a 5-F catheter <br>is left wedged in the thrombus for overnight local thrombolysis infusion. <br>Thrombolysis is allowed to proceed only if there are no contraindications <br>such as recent variceal bleeding or multiple errant punctures made during <br>the PV access (19). Recanalization of chronic PV occlusion is difficult and <br>should be performed as an elective procedure by an experienced <br>interventional radiologist. In this procedure, we use transjugular access as <br>a primary approach and transhepatic or trans-splenic as auxiliary accesses <br>if transjugular approach fails. In some cases, combined approach is <br>necessary as the initial one (20, 21). The crucial step is crossing the <br>occluded segment of the vein by hydrophilic guidewire. Balloon angioplasty <br>is performed with a 4-5-mm balloon catheter. Portogram should follow <br>immediately after dilatation to exclude extravasation. Recanalized segment <br>is definitively dilated with a bare stent, including intrahepatic channel. <br>Usually two overlapped stents are required to cover the whole tract. <br>Embolization of portosystemic collaterals can facilitate blood flow through <br>the shunt. Stent implantation should be performed always with respect to <br>future liver transplant (22-24). Besides complications of TIPS or <br>transhepatic access, there is a higher risk of intraperitoneal bleeding in <br>the recanalization of chronic PV occlusion. This increased risk is because <br>of more complex procedures lasting usually twice as long as regular TIPS. <br>Acute rethrombosis of relatively long shunt can occur early. This can be <br>facilitated by low flow through the shunt and possible hypercoagulation <br>syndrome presented in patients with myeloproliferative disease. These <br>patients require strict <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, and the longterm patency of their <br>shunts is always worse than that in patients with regular <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span>. <br>Technical success rate in acute PV thrombosis does not differ from the usual <br>TIPS. Good long-term patency in patients with thrombophilia has to be <br>maintained by <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy, and more frequent ultrasonographic <br>controls are required to reveal asymptomatic stenosis of the shunt. Use of <br>dedicated ePTFE stent-grafts is recommended in these patients because these <br>stent-grafts proved to be less thrombogenic than bare stents. Technical <br>success rate of recanalization procedures performed for chronic PV occlusion <br>varies among centers. It has been reported from 35% to 100%.

Date of <br>Publication: 1 Sep 2015<br><br>Background/Aims: This study aimed to investigate the incidence and risk <br>factors of portal vein system thrombosis (PVST) in patients with liver <br>cirrhosis after splenectomy and pericardial devascularization. Materials and <br>Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 71 patients who underwent splenectomy <br>with pericardial devascularization for portal hypertension due to cirrhosis. <br>Patients were categorized into Group A (n=23): early prophylactic <br>anticoagulants therapy; Group B (n=29): late prophylactic anticoagulants <br>therapy; and Group C (n=19): no <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy. Univariate and <br>multivariate analyses of the risk factors of PVST were performed. The <br>incidence of PVST and the effect of thrombolytic therapy were evaluated. <br>Results: Multivariate analysis revealed a wider preoperative splenic vein <br>diameter (≥8 mm), and lower preoperative platelet counts (<50∼109/L) were <br>significantly correlated with PVST development. The incidence of PVST in <br>Groups A, B, and C was 26.1% (6/23), 44.8% (13/29), and 52.6% (10/19), <br>respectively (all p>0.05). The complete resolution rate of portal, superior <br>mesenteric, and splenic vein thrombosis was 75%, 62.5%, and 23.8%, <br>respectively. Conclusion: A wider preoperative splenic vein diameter and <br>lower preoperative platelet counts are independent risk factors of PVST. <br>Early <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy had a tendency towards a reduced incidence of <br>PVST, but it was not statistically significant.

Date of Publication: 6 <br>Aug 2015<br><br>Aims: Although quantitative anti-FXa assays can be used to measure <br>rivaroxaban plasma levels, they are not widely performed or available. We <br>aimed to tentatively determine the cut-off for thromboembolism and bleeding <br>prevention based on the clotting effect of non-rivaroxaban <br>conjugate-activated FX plasma levels in patients with rivaroxaban using a <br>coagulometric method. Methods and results: Rivaroxaban was added in vitro to <br>normal plasma at a range of 0 to 241 μg/L to cover expected peak and trough <br>levels. Rivaroxaban chromogenic (μg/L) and RVV-confirm as a ratio were <br>determined. Patient plasma samples were assayed with the RVV-confirm <br>reagent. The appropriate rivaroxaban plasma concentration to inhibit <br>clotting mechanisms was based on the remaining FXa in plasma, which was <br>expressed as the ratio of patients/normal, R-C. There is a high correlation <br>between R-C in vitro and spiked normal plasma rivaroxaban concentration <br>(R-Square 0.910, linear equation; 0.971 quadratic equation, p < 0.0001 for <br>both) but not with plasma rivaroxaban chromogenic assays. We propose a <br>cut-off R-C value of 1.65 and 4.5 for safety. Based on the proposed <br>therapeutic range, in 158 assays performed in 58 patients, 6.3 % assays were <br>above the level of bleeding tendency at the peak (R-C 5.39 ± 1.01, median <br>5.13) and 42 % assays were below the prevention cut-off at the trough (R-C <br>1.31 ± 0.18, median 1.35). Conclusions: RVVconfirm® is fast and sensitive to <br>measure the effect of rivaroxaban.

Hanna P. Beche C. Coupez L. Saint-Eve P.<br>Obesity Surgery (2015) 25:1 SUPPL. 1 (S342). Date of Publication: August <br>2015<br><br>Introduction: Thrombosis of the portal vein or one of its branches has been <br>documented after laparoscopic procedures; however it is very rare after <br>bariatric surgery. Several etiologies have been suggested (infection, <br>inflammation, trauma, malignancy...) Objectives: Early diagnosis and <br>treatment of this entity may avoid its progression. Methods: A 61-year-old <br>diabetic woman, with previous history of deep venous thrombosis, underwent <br>gastric bypass for morbid obesity. The operation was performed in a standard <br>technique (Lonroth). Operative time was 120 min. The left lobe of the liver <br>was retracted with a liver retractor held by an articulated arm. <br>Postoperatively the patient received preventive dose of low molecular weight <br>heparin twice daily. On the third postoperative day, the patient started to <br>have abdominal pain, fever and leukocytosis (23000/mm(3)). An enhanced CT <br>scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed thrombosis of left branch of the <br>portal vein with signs of liver ischemia. There were no signs of anastomotic <br>leak. Results: Therapeutic dose of low molecular weight heparin was started. <br>The patient had progressive significant improvement over few days. CT scan 4 <br>weeks later showed complete resolution of the <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> and <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was stopped at 8 weeks postoperatively. Conclusion: Our <br>patient presents multiple risk factors of venous thrombosis. However this <br>isolated thrombosis of a branch of the left portal vein suggests a traumatic <br>factor due to the liver retractor held by an articulated arm for more than <br>an hour. Therefore, while operating patients with multiple risk factors, we <br>recommend a gentle and intermittent retraction of the left lobe of the liver <br>whenever possible.<br><br>RECORD 161<br>Extracorporeal Elimination of Piperacillin/Tazobactam during Molecular <br>Adsorbent Recirculating System Therapy<br>Personett H.A.

Of particular interest to acute care <br>practitioners is the impact of MARS on antibiotic clearance, as suboptimal <br>concentrations of such drugs can negatively impact patient outcomes. The <br>properties of piperacillin/tazobactam suggest that elimination may be <br>enhanced in the setting of MARS therapy. We describe two cases in which this <br>was studied. Piperacillin concentrations were determined at various points <br>within the MARS circuit, and patient serum concentrations were reported <br>throughout the dosing interval while receiving MARS therapy.

Date of Publication: July 2015<br><br>Introduction: Pediatric liver transplant is the treatment of choice in <br>several end stage liver diseases in children, with reported one-year <br>survival rates of 90%. We started a new pediatric liver transplant program <br>in 2009. Our aim is to communicate the results of the program during the <br>first 5 years. Methods: Retrospective review of clinical database of <br>pediatric liver transplants (LT). Results: Since May 2009, 18 LT in 16 <br>patients were performed, 9 boys and 7 girls. The average age was 2y 6m old <br>(from 6m to 12y), with an average weight of 12.8±8 kg (from 5.5kg to 38kg). <br>Median follow up was 43.8 months. Indications for LT were: Biliary atresia <br>(BA) (8), acute liver failure (4), hepatoblastoma (2), Alagille's syndrome <br>(1) and OTC deficit (1). Over this period we performed 10 Living donor LT, <br>six deceased donor LT and two Split LT. The hepatic artery reconstruction <br>was performed under microscope in 11 patients (9 living donors and 2 <br>splits). Immunosupresion regimen included steroids and tacrolimus. Three <br>patients died during follow up: two patients with BA died in the early post <br>op period, one due to <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> and another due to hemorrhage <br>secondary to graft outflow obstruction in a large for size graft; the third <br>patient died 9 months after LT due to doxorubicin related heart failure. The <br>one year survival rate of the program was 81,6%. Other complications <br>included: another patient with <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>, successfully <br>corrected with surgery, two patients with significant portal vein stenosis <br>treated with surgery and percutaneous dilation, one patient with <br>suprahepatic vein thrombosis treated with <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. We had no hepatic <br>artery thrombosis in this series. Four patients developed biliary <br>complications, 3 of them required surgery. Two patients had mild biopsy <br>proven rejection reverted with steroids, and one patient has chronic <br>rejection. All of our patients have returned to a normal life after LT. <br>Conclusions: The creation of a pediatric LT program is a challenging <br>opportunity for a transplant center. Our perioperative, short and long-term <br>results are comparable to those reported in the literature in the field.<br><br>RECORD 166<br>Early prophylactic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> via transjugular intrahepatic route for <br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> after splenectomy in cirrhotic portal hypertension<br>Yang S.

Materials and Methods This <br>retrospective study included 98 cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension <br>who underwent open splenectomy (48 men and 50 women; age, 45.4 y ± 13.6). <br>Systemic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was given to 52 patients in group I, and <br>transcatheter <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was performed in 46 patients in group II. <br>Results The technical success rate of catheterization by the transjugular <br>intrahepatic route was 93.5% in group II. The 30-day (6.52% vs 23.1%, P <br><.05) and 6-month (8.70% vs 26.9%, P <.05) incidences of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> were <br>significantly lower in group II than in group I. The postoperative bleeding <br>rate was 6.52% in group II and 25% in group I (P <.05). There was no <br>significant difference between groups in 30-day (5.77% vs 2.17%) and 6-month <br>(1.92% vs 6.52%) mortality. After splenectomy, the portal trunk vessel <br>diameter was 16.0 mm ± 3.5 in group I and 14.5 mm ± 2.5 in group II (P <br><.05). The portal flow velocity was 25.9 cm/s ± 7.1 in group I and 28.2 cm/s <br>± 5.3 in group II (P >.05).

The aim of the present study was to evaluate <br>the thrombophilic role of HCC as risk factor for development of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. <br>Methods: cirrhotic patients with and without HCC were prospectively enrolled <br>in the study and underwent: thromboelastometry (ROTEM), platelet count, <br>determination of prothrombin time and of levels of pro and <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>factors. During follow-up, <span style="color: red">PVT</span> onset in both patients with and without HCC <br>was recorded. Results: 76 cirrhotics, 41 with HCC, were included. Volume of <br>active HCC was >5 cm(2) in 18 patients. Levels of pro and <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>factors were similar between patients with and without HCC, but fibrinogen <br>was increased in HCC patients with active volume [>5cm(2) HCC compared to <br>those with <5cm(2)HCC bulk (348,72mg/dL±124,06mg/dL vs 237,64mg/ <br>dL±99,18mg/dL) and to cirrhotics without HCC (260,57mg/dL±126,07mg/ dL) <br>(p=0,006). Platelet count was significantly increased in HCC compared to <br>non-HCC patients, and this was especially true in Child A group. ROTEM <br>demonstrated a significantly lower clotting time and maximum clot formation <br>in HCC patients compared to controls and non-HCC cirrhotics, especially in <br>Child A group. The incidence of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was 24,4% (10/41) and 11.4% (4/35) in <br>HCC and non-HCC patients, respectively (OR: 2,5; 95%, CI 0,70-8,83). In the <br>HCC group, 5/10 portal vein thromboses occurred in patients in Child Class <br>A. Fibrinogen test of ROTEM, MCF and AUC were statistically greater in HCC <br>patients who later developed <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Conclusions: cirrhotics with HCC <br>demonstrate a prothrombotic hemostatic balance resulting in an increased <br>risk of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> development.

AIM: This is a case report of a LT recipient who had a <br>successful pregnancy on basiliximab, cyclosporine (CSA), azathioprine (AZA), <br>and prednisone. CASE: A 29 year old Hispanic female received a living-donor <br>LT from her sister for AIH related-cirrhosis. Initial immunosuppression (IS) <br>were tacrolimus (TC) and steroids, but elevation in her liver enzymes <br>prompted the addition of MPA and prevented weaning of steroids. At month 6, <br>she developed a portal vein thrombus and had a percutaneous thrombectomy. <br>She was diagnosed with hypercoagulability secondary to antiphospholipid <br>syndrome and was started on <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. She also developed posterior <br>reversible encephalopathy syndrome that prompted a change from TC to CSA. <br>While on the combination of CSA, MPA, and steroids, she had multiple <br>episodes of biopsy-proven acute rejection at month 8, year 2 and year 4 <br>following LT, and she developed recurrent AIH at year 2. Her graft function <br>finally stabilized on higher trough CSA levels of 200-250, MPA 720 mg bid, <br>and prednisone 10 mg daily. Despite high risks to her own health, she <br>expressed her desire to become pregnant. Stabilization of graft function for <br>a full year after the last acute rejection episode was established, then she <br>was switched from MPA to AZA 50 mg daily and basiliximab at 40 mg IV <br>infusions monthly, with continuation of CSA and prednisone 10 mg daily. <br>Stable graft function was confirmed for three months on this novel regimen <br>before she was allowed to conceive. She became pregnant and successfully <br>carried her pregnancy to full term on this regimen with stable graft <br>function throughout, and delivered a healthy baby boy. Her post-partum <br>course was complicated by a small subdural hematoma attributed to her <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, which resolved with no permanent neurologic sequelae. She <br>has resumed her pre-pregnancy IS without any graft compromise. CONCLUSION: <br>Monthly basiliximab infusions can be an acceptable alternative maintenance <br>IS during pregnancy, particularly in patients whose graft function require <br>potent IS agents that cannot be continued during pregnancy.

Budd-Chiari syndrome presents <br>with acute or chronic, asymptomatic or severe liver disease. Diagnosis <br>depends on noninvasive imaging of the obstructed hepatic venous outflow <br>tract. A spontaneously fatal course can be prevented by a stepwise approach: <br>(1) <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy, specific therapy for underlying disease, and <br>medical or endoscopic management of liver-related complications, (2) <br>angioplasty/stenting in a second step, and (3) eventually the insertion of <br>transjugular intrahepatic stent shunt or liver transplantation.

Date of Publication: 16 Jun 2015<br><br>Objectives This study aims to determine the risk factors, diagnostic methods <br>employed, treatment modalities, and outcome in patients with splanchnic vein <br>thrombosis (SVT). Methods A retrospective chart review of patients, age 18 <br>to 90 years, diagnosed with SVT at a single institution from January 1, 2010 <br>to November 10, 2012. They were grouped as <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> <br>(<span style="color: red">PVT</span>)-including those combined with splenic vein thrombosis (S<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) or <br>mesenteric vein thrombosis (MVT)--and Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS). Results <br>Overall 246 SVT patients were identified, including 225 <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and 21 BCS. Risk <br>factors were liver disease, upper abdominal (regional) cancer and surgery, <br>pancreatitis, and hereditary thrombophilia. The most common symptom was <br>abdominal pain and most patients had abnormal liver function. Among those <br>tested, the JAK2 V617F mutation was present in only 20% of the patients with <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span> and 14% of the patients with BCS. Most patients were diagnosed by <br>computed tomography.

Date of Publication: <br>2015<br><br>Introduction: Abernethy malformation (AM) is a rare congenital disease with <br>portal blood diversion from the liver: it includes congenital absence of the <br>portal vein, portosystemic shunt, liver nodes, congenital heart disorders <br>such as atrial/ventricular septal defect and patent doctus arteriosus. In <br>type 1 AM blood is diverted from portal system to inferior vena cava (IVC) <br>and intrahepatic portal flood is absent. In type 2 AM there is a partial <br>diversion and the portal system is twisting. Etiology is unknown <br>(intrauterine infection). Venous stasis, even without other prothrombotic <br>factors, may induce <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> and severe bleeding <br>complications. Case report: A 33 year old man was admitted for recurrent <br>oral aphta. He had a history of intrauterine toxoplasmosis. In 2003 he had <br>had an incidental echographic diagnosis of spleno-portomesenteric vein <br>dilatation with perigastric porto-caval shunts (type 2 AM); it was <br>associated with hepatic focal nodal hyperplasia but not with portal <br>hypertension. In 2012, back from a tour in Australia, he complained of a <br>severe epigastric pain and hematemesis: blood transfusions were needed. <br>Gastroscopic examination showed F3 varices that were ligated. At CT a large <br>portal cavernoma was found with splenic and mesenteric vein thrombosis. He <br>was treated with enoxaparin with gradual recovery. Trombophylia and Bechet <br>syndrome were excluded. Conclusions: AM causes venous stasis with possible <br>severe throm-botic complications. Portal cavernoma could benefit from <br>chronic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> (INR 2-2,5), with haemoglobin and varices <br>monitoring.<br><br>RECORD 175<br>Antithrombotic treatment and outcomes of cirrhotic patients with splanchnic <br>vein thrombosis: A sub-study from the ISTH registry<br>Riva N.

Dentali F.<br>Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015) 13 SUPPL. 2 (69-70). Date of <br>Publication: June 2015<br><br>Background: Cirrhotic patients have often been excluded from studies <br>addressing the anticoagulant treatment of splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT), <br>although <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> is associated with an increased risk of SVT through <br>hypercoagulability. Aims: To assess the outcomes of cirrhotic patients from <br>an unselected cohort of SVT patients. Methods: International prospective <br>registry of consecutive SVT patients, enrolled from 2008 to 2012. <br>Therapeutic strategies and outcomes were analysed separately for cirrhotic <br>patients. A Central Adjudication Committee reviewed and classified clinical <br>outcomes as vascular events (venous or arterial thrombosis) and major <br>bleeding (MB; ISTH definition plus the need for hospitalization). Results: A <br>toal of 167 (28%) of 604 patients had <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> (median age 59 years, <br>70.7% males, 79.6% <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>, 49.4% inci- dentally detected <br>SVT). Sixty-six patients (39.5%) received no <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>; 62 received <br>parenteral anticoagulants alone (median duration 6 months, IQR 3-15) and 39 <br>were started on vitamin K antagonists (median 10 months, IQR 4-24). Median <br>follow-up duration was 2 years (IQR 0.5-2); 5 patients (3.0%) were lost to <br>follow-up. The overall incidence of recurrent thrombotic events was 11.3/100 <br>patient-years (pt-y) (95% CI 7.7-16.8) and the incidence of MB was 10.0/100 <br>pt-y (95% CI 6.6-15.1). The incidence of these two outcomes in never-treated <br>cirrhotic patients was 14.1/100 pt-y and 11.3/100 pt-y, respectively. In <br>multivariate analysis, anticoagulant treatment was associated with lower <br>rates of both vascular events (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.77-0.96) and MB (HR 0.83, <br>95% CI 0.69-0.99). Conclusion: Our real-life data suggest that more than a <br>half of cirrhotic patients with SVT receive anticoagulant treatment. The <br>incidence of thrombotic and bleeding complications was not negligible in <br>this subgroup of patients. In selected cirrhotic patients, the anticoagulant <br>treatment, usually administered at adjusted doses according to the <br>individual risk of bleeding, appeared to be beneficial.<br><br>RECORD 176<br>Portal vein reconstruction in adult living donor liver transplantation for <br>patients with <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in single center experience<br>Mori A.

In comparison to deceased donor LT, <br>living donor LT (LDLT) still presents additional difficulties in determining <br>appropriate vein grafts and overcoming small-for-size syndrome. Here, we <br>introduce our LDLT strategies and assess their outcomes in adult patients <br>with pre-existing <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Methods We performed 282 consecutive adult LDLTs <br>between April 2006 and December 2011. Forty-eight patients (17%) had <br>pre-existing <span style="color: red">PVT</span> (grade I; 15, II; 20, III; 12, IV; 1). Results Our <br>preferred treatments for <span style="color: red">PVT</span> were thrombectomies/thromboendovenectomies in <br>30 patients, replaced grafts in seven, jump grafts in seven, renoportal <br>anastomosis in one and no surgical intervention owing to minimal thrombosis <br>in three. Post-transplant portal vein complications occurred in eight of 48 <br>(17%) cases, which were treated by surgery, <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy, and/or <br>interventional radiology.

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2015<br><br>Introduction: The development of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) in patients <br>with end stage liver disease (ESLD) is a multifactorial process, primarily <br>from reduction of portal flow, damage to the vessel wall and <br>hypercoagulability. Development of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is often accompanied by increased <br>rate of morbidity and mortality. There is limited data regarding the role of <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy in patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span>. Aim: To <br>assess the outcome of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in patients with <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> and <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Methods: This was a retrospective observational study conducted in the <br>Department of Medical Gastroenterology, Govt. Medical College Trivandrum. <br>All patients with cirrhosis and <span style="color: red">PVT</span> who received anticoagulant treatment, <br>admitted in our department from January 2010 to December 2014 were included <br>in the study. Data was collected from electronic medical records using a <br>self developed proforma. Patients were excluded if they had incomplete <br>medical records or had not completed 6 months of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. <br>Statistical analysis was done using SPSS-17. Results: There was a total of <br>46 cases of cirrhosis with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> who underwent <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> during the <br>study period. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was initiated using Enoxaparin or Fondaparinux <br>and continued for a period of 6 months with oral warfarin. Enoxaparin and <br>Fondaparinux was used in 29 and 17 cases, respectively. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> resolved in 18 <br>(39%) patients, no change in 8 (18%) patients, and 20 (43%) patients showed <br>partial resolution of thrombus on ultrasound Doppler evaluation. <br>Complications noted were 4 cases of GI bleed (melena), 1 case of bleeding PV <br>and 3 case of skin bleed.

Date of <br>Publication: 30 May 2015<br><br>Idiopathic non-cirrhotic portal hypertension (INCPH) is a rare disease <br>characterized of intrahepatic portal hypertension in the absence of <br>cirrhosis or other causes of liver disease and splanchnic venous thrombosis. <br>The etiology of INCPH can be classified in five categories: 1) immunological <br>disorders (i.e. association with common variable immunodeficiency syndrome, <br>connective tissue diseases, Crohn's disease, etc.), 2) chronic infections, <br>3) exposure to medications or toxins (e.g. azathioprine, 6-thioguanine, <br>arsenic), 4) genetic predisposition (i.e. familial aggregation and <br>association with Adams-Oliver syndrome and Turner disease) and 5) <br>prothrombotic conditions (e.g. inherited thrombophilias myeloproliferative <br>neoplasm antiphospholipid syndrome). Roughly, INCPH diagnosis is based on <br>clinical criteria and the formal exclusion of any other causes of portal <br>hypertension. A formal diagnosis is based on the following criteria: 1) <br>presence of unequivocal signs of portal hypertension, 2) absence of <br>cirrhosis, advanced fibrosis or other causes of chronic liver diseases, and <br>3) absence of thrombosis of the hepatic veins or of the portal vein at <br>imaging. Patients with INCPH usually present with signs or symptoms of <br>portal hypertension such as gastro-esophageal varices, variceal bleeding or <br>splenomegaly. Ascites and/or liver failure can occur in the context of <br>precipitating factors. The development of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> is common. <br>Survival is manly limited by concomitant disorders. Currently, treatment of <br>INCPH relies on the prevention of complications related to portal <br>hypertension, following current guidelines of cirrhotic portal hypertension. <br>No treatment has been studied aimed to modify the natural history of the <br>disease. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy can be considered in patients who develop <br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>.<br><br>RECORD 179<br>Hepatic portal venous gas and portal venous thrombosis following colonoscopy <br>in a patient with terminal ileal Crohn's disease<br>Ma A.S.C.

Date of Publication: <br>May 2015<br><br>Background: Chronic, occlusive <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) associated with <br>cirrhosis represents a relative contraindication to liver transplantation <br>(LT) in some centers. From a surgical perspective, portal vein <br>recanalization-transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (PVR-TIPS) may <br>facilitate LT and enhance transplant eligibility. Our objective was to <br>evaluate the effect of PVR-TIPS on liver function, transplant eligibility <br>and long-term outcomes following liver transplantation (LT). Methods: 44 <br>patients with chronic main <span style="color: red">PVT</span> were identified during our institutional LT <br>selection committee and, following joint imaging review by transplant <br>surgery/radiology, were referred to interventional radiology for PVR-TIPS to <br>enhance transplant eligibility. Following PVR-TIPS, patients were followed <br>by hepatology/transplant until LT, and in posttransplant clinic. Baseline <br>characteristics were recorded, TIPS venography and serial ultrasound/MRI <br>were used subsequently to document PV patency. Results: The main portal vein <br>(MPV) was completely thrombosed in 17/44 (39%) patients; near complete <br>(>95%) occlusion was noted in 27/44 (61%). Direct transhepatic and <br>trans-splenic punctures were required in 11/43 (26%) and 3/43 cases (7%), <br>respectively. Technical success was 43/44 (98%). At PVR-TIPS completion, <br>persistence of MPV thrombus was noted in 33/43 (77%).

We evaluate the <br>effect of a perioperative strategy of prevention and early diagnosis on the <br>incidence of vascular complications and outcome. Methods: from December 2008 <br>to July 2014, 107 liver transplantations were performed in 106 children. The <br>strategy included: -high flow vascular reconstructions, use of microsurgical <br>technique, repeated intraoperative Doppler ultrasound (US) -regular <br>post-operative Doppler US follow up (peak velocities and arterial resistance <br>index) -<span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> and anti-platelet prophylaxis as per protocol -high <br>level of suspicion of thrombosis with preemptive and immediate management <br>Results: Intraoperative period: immediate good flows were observed at <br>Doppler US in 95 cases (88.7%). In 9 cases the flow was absent either at <br>declamping or after abdomen closure: revision with graft repositioning, redo <br>of anastomosis, prosthetic abdominal closure allowed to correct the problem. <br>In 3 cases the flow was non-optimal in hepatic artery/portal vein (1/2) <br>despite revision, however it improved after few days under <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. <br>Early postoperative complications: 5 patients with signs of splenic steal <br>syndrome were managed either by interventional radiology (N=3) or surgery <br>(N=2). One early hepatic artery thrombosis underwent to successful surgical <br>redo. Late complications (> 30 days): 2 late hepatic artery (HA) stenosis <br>were treated by radiological balloon dilatation while 1 thrombosis was <br>managed conservatively. Late portal vein stricture was diagnosed in 5 <br>patients: all underwent to successful trans-hepatic angioplasty (1 stent). <br>Two patients with portal vein (PV) thrombosis were treated by meso-Rex <br>bypass. There were no hepatic vein or inferior vena cava complications in <br>the series. Overall outcome: although 28 patients (25%) presented at some <br>point with signs of vascular complications, 90% was successfully treated. <br>Among 3 patients with vascular thrombosis (2 PV and 1 HA), 2 of them were <br>cured by meso-Rex bypass.

More than half of cirrhotics will have low platelet counts, but <br>neutropenia is much less common. Despite being common in the cirrhotic <br>population, the presence of hypersplenism is of little clinical consequence. <br>The presence of hypersplenism suggests more advanced liver disease and an <br>increase in risk of complications, but there is no data showing that <br>correcting the hypersplenism improves patient survival. In most series, the <br>most common indications for treating the hypersplenism is to increase <br>platelet and white blood cell counts to allow for use of drugs that suppress <br>the bone marrow such as interferon alpha and chemotherapeutic agents. There <br>are several approaches used to treat hypersplenism. Portosystemic shunts are <br>of questionable benefit. Splenectomy, either open or laparoscopically, is <br>the most effective but is associated with a significant risk of portal vein <br>thrombosis. Partial splenic artery embolization and radiofrequency ablation <br>are effective methods for treating hypersplenism, but counts tend to fall <br>back to baseline long-term. Pharmacological agents are also effective in <br>increasing platelet counts. Development of direct acting antivirals against <br>hepatitis C will eliminate the most common indication for treatment. We lack <br>controlled trials designed to determine if treating the hypersplenism has <br>benefits other than raising the platelet and white blood cell counts. In the <br>absence of such studies, hypersplenism in most patients should be considered <br>a laboratory abnormality and not treated, in other words forget it.<br><br>RECORD 183<br>The role of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> for <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> prior to orthotopic <br>liver transplantation<br>Bozanich N.K.

Data <br>abstracted included demographic data, anatomic extent of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, presence/type <br>of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, effect on <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, complications of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, and <br>outcomes after transplant including use of jump graft and survival. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was <br>classified as occlusive or non-occlusive involving portal vein with or <br>without extension. The decision to anticoagulate was made by a <br>multidisciplinary team at selection conference. Results: 43/333 (13%) <br>patients were diagnosed with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> before OLT by axial imaging. Median age was <br>59 years (IQR= 52-63), 27/43 male, median BMI 28 (IQR= 25.7-33), median MELD <br>score 20 (IQR= 17-25). <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was diagnosed at median of 338 days prior to OLT. <br>In 30/43 patients <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was initiated (27 warfarin, 3 enoxaparin) <br>prior to OLT for median duration of 9 months (IQR 5- 17). The median time to <br>demonstrated improvement or resolution of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was 5 months (IQR 3- 7.2). <br>19/30(63%) of anticoagulated patients achieved partial to full <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>resolution at time of OLT compared to 8/14 patients (57%) in whom no <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was initiated. 3 patients with partial or full resolution of <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span> had recurrent thrombosis post OLT. 3 patients required jump grafts due <br>to thrombosis. In the entire <span style="color: red">PVT</span> cohort, there were 5 deaths post OLT (2 no <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, 1 warfarin, 2 enoxaparin). 1 month survival (no <br>anti-coagulation 86% ;warfarin 100%;enoxaparin 67%), 6 month survival (no <br>anti-coagulation 86% ;warfarin 96%%;enoxaparin 33%)and 1 year survival (no <br>anti-coagulation 85% ;warfarin 94%;enoxaparin 0%) were superior in the <br>warfarin treated group compared to enoxaparin or no <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>(p<0.05). Bleeding complications were rare with no difference noted between <br>the anticoagulated and non-anticoagulated groups. Conclusion: <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> for <span style="color: red">PVT</span> prior to OLT is safe, and lead to partial or <br>complete resolution in 19/30 patients. Improved survival was noted in the <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span> cohort who received <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> with warfarin prior to OLT. Data <br>collection is ongoing to better refine which <span style="color: red">PVT</span> patients derive benefit <br>with this strategy.<br><br>RECORD 184<br>A differential to remember: Pylephlebitis in a patient with HIV presenting <br>with abdominal pain and fever<br>Sliwa D.F. Ryzewicz S.<br>Journal of General Internal Medicine (2015) 30 SUPPL. 2 (S336). Date of <br>Publication: April 2015<br><br>LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1: Recognize pylephlebitis as part of the differential <br>diagnosis in a patient with abdominal pain and fever, especially in patients <br>with HIV/AIDS. LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2: Recognize the challenge of deciding <br>whether to initiate <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> given the underlying etiology of <br>pylephlebitis. CASE: A 46-year-old male with a background history of HIV on <br>HAART, Hepatitis C in remission, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, GERD and <br>depression presented to the emergency room with epigastric pain, associated <br>with mild nausea and loose, black stools. He took ibuprofen, pepto bismol <br>and Alka-Seltzer at home without relief. In the emergency room, the patient <br>developed a fever of 102.7, rigors and vomiting. Two weeks prior the patient <br>had similar symptoms, which resolved. He denied sick contacts, recent travel <br>or new food exposure. The remainder of the physical exam was significant for <br>a heart rate of 120 and a stable blood pressure and respiratory rate. He had <br>mild epigastric and right upper quadrant tenderness. There was no <br>organomegaly or icterus. Initial laboratory studies demonstrated <br>leukocytosis and elevated transaminases and total bilirubin. Lactate and <br>lipase were normal. His most recent CD4 count was >1000 with a viral load of <br><50. Chest x-ray and abdominal CT with IV contrast were negative for acute <br>processes. An abdominal ultrasound revealed biliary sludge without acute <br>cholecystitis. EKG showed sinus tachycardia. The patient was started on IV <br>fluids and antibiotics and admitted for further evaluation of a probable <br>intraabdominal infection. Due to a continuing rise in the patient's <br>transaminases and bilirubin, an MRI of the abdomen was completed and <br>revealed thrombosis of the left portal vein, enlarged porta hepatis and <br>reactive peripancreatic lymph nodes. Blood cultures grew Klebsiella <br>pneumoniae, however stool and urine cultures were negative for growth. A <br>diagnosis of pylephlebitis was made based on the presence of leukocytosis, <br>fever and <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. The patient was treated for 4 weeks with <br>Levofloxacin. An outpatient work-up for thrombophilia was negative and due <br>to the bacteremia being the likely cause of the <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>, <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was not initiated. DISCUSSION: Pylephlebitis is an uncommon <br>but critical diagnosis to make in patients presenting with abdominal pain <br>and fever, especially those with HIV/AIDS. Diagnostic criteria include <br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>, fever, and often, bacteremia. Although pylephlebitis <br>was universally fatal in the preantibiotic era, the morbidity and mortality <br>have decreased with early identification and antibiotic management. There is <br>data suggesting that people living with HIV and AIDS are at a 2 to 10 fold <br>greater risk of venous thromboembolic disease compared to age-matched <br>controls. Therefore, it is important to consider pylephlebitis in the <br>differential diagnosis when evaluating HIV/AIDS patients presenting with <br>these symptoms. Furthermore, <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in pylephlebitis is not well <br>described in the literature, making the decision to anticoagulate these <br>patients a difficult one. In the case of our patient, the etiology of the <br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> was the pylephlebitis, making <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>unnecessary with adequate antibiotic treatment. However, it is prudent to <br>rule out underlying hypercoagulable states and to ensure complete response <br>to antibiotics before deciding against <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>.<br><br>RECORD 185<br>Should patients with hepatocellelar carcinoma complicated by portal vein <br>thrombosis be treated with <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>?<br>Mahmoudi T.M. Kayal A. Carvalho R. Weiss A.<br>Gastroenterology (2015) 148:4 SUPPL. 1 (S650-S651). Date of Publication: <br>April 2015<br><br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is a seen in about 14.3% of patients with <br>hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). There is presently no evidence based <br>guideline on the need for <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in this particular group of <br>patients. The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the <br>clinical outcome of patients with HCC complicated by <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. <br>Patients and methods: 54 patients who were diagnosed with HCC and <span style="color: red">PVT</span> from <br>July 21st 2001 to September 131st, 2014 were retrospectively evaluated. Nine <br>patients were excluded secondary to lack of follow up. HCC and <span style="color: red">PVT</span> diagnosis <br>and follow up was determined with contrast enhanced CT or MRI. Most of the <br>patients were initially treated with a single or a combination of the <br>following treatments: transarterial chemoembolization, radiofrequency <br>ablation, surgical resection, systemic therapy with Sorafenib. <br>Characteristics and results are shown in table 1. 38 patients were males and <br>mean age was 62.8. Liver disease etiology was HCV in 42%, HBV in 40%, ETOH <br>in 11% and hemochromatosis in 2%. Results: Average survival after HCC <br>diagnosis was 28 months and 15 months after <span style="color: red">PVT</span> diagnosis. Among the 45 <br>patients evaluated, 6 patients received <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> while 39 did not. <br>Progression happened in 19 (49%) of the non anticoagulated group, and 4 <br>(67%) of the anticoagulated group. Right portal vein involvement was seen in <br>18 (40%) patients with progression in 67% of the time, Left <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in 13 (28%) <br>with a progression in 54%, and Main <span style="color: red">PVT</span> 6 (13%) with a progression in (67%). <br>In 1 case, <span style="color: red">PVT</span> progressed from the main <span style="color: red">PVT</span> to Superior mesenteric vein <br>(SMV) and in 2 other cases from the Left portal vein to SMV. Ascites was <br>present in 2 patients, at the time <span style="color: red">PVT</span> diagnosis but no symptoms or adverse <br>clinical sequalae directly related to <span style="color: red">PVT</span> development were reported in the <br>other 43 patients. Conclusion, in our review of 45 patients with HCC <br>complicated by chronic <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, there was no adverse clinical consequence. The <br>rate of progression of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> determined by contrast enhanced CT or MRI imaging <br>was similar in the group treated with <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> and the non <br>anticoagulated group of patients. Thus, the need for <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, <br>considering its risks in patients with HCC and <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, needs to be carefully <br>assessed. The usefulness of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in this patient population needs <br>to be further studied.

Romero M. González C. De La Cruz G. Sánchez J.J. <br>Gómez R.<br>Journal of Hepatology (2015) 62 SUPPL. 2 (S364). Date of Publication: April <br>2015<br><br>Background and Aims: The prevalence of nonmalignant <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> <br>(<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) ranges from 10 to 25% in patients with <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> and it is <br>associated with a worsening of its natural course. Optimal management of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>in cirrhosis is not available in any consensus publication. Nevertheless, it <br>seems that <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> may constitute the initial treatment. The aim of <br>our study was to evaluate the results of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy in a group <br>of cirrhotic patients with non-malignant <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Methods: 27 cirrhotic patients <br>with non-malignant <span style="color: red">PVT</span> were studied retrospectively in our hospital between <br>March 2009 and March 2014. Both diagnosis and follow-up of patients were <br>performed by Doppler and contrast-enhanced ultrasound and by computed <br>tomography. Results: 27 patients (14 women, mean age: 59±11.8 years) were <br>evaluated. All cases were incidental findings during routine <br>ultrasonography. The mean MELD score was 10 (range: 6-22). 11% were on <br>active liver transplant list. 26 patients received <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>: 23 <br>low-molecular-weight heparin and three oral <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. The median time <br>from diagnosis to the initiation of treatment was 2 weeks. The outcome in <br>18/26 patients was recanalization, 15 complete (57.6%). The median time <br>until achieving this complete response was 10 months (95% CI: 3-17). <br>Rethrombosis occurred in five of the patients who had discontinued treatment <br>after complete recanalization (35.7%). Patients with no response to <br>treatment, did not show progression of thrombosis. Only two patients, one of <br>them with 30,000 platelets, presented a bleeding complication (mild in both <br>cases). No significant differences regarding the appearance of portal <br>hypertensionrelated complications were observed. Patients with MELD score <br>below 8 achieved recanalization in a significantly shorter time compared to <br>the other patients (p = 0.04). Six patients died, four from complications of <br>liver disease, but not related with <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. Thrombophilia testing <br>was performed in 22 patients and five of them had a positive result: three <br>with Factor V Leiden mutation, one with JAK2 gene mutation and another with <br>hyperhomocysteinemia. Conclusions: In cirrhotic patients with nonmalignant <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span>, <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy led to recanalization in over half of cases, <br>with a broad safety profile. Best outcomes seem to be achieved in a less <br>advanced stage of liver disease. Due to the existing rethrombosis rate, <br>long-term <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> should be considered.<br><br>RECORD 187<br>Acute <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>: Clinical features, diagnosis and outcomes <br>after 5 years of follow-up<br>Peixoto A. Silva M. Pereira P. Macedo G.<br>Journal of Hepatology (2015) 62 SUPPL. 2 (S836). Date of Publication: April <br>2015<br><br>Background and Aims: Acute <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (A<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is a rare <br>thrombotic obstruction of extrahepatic/intrahepatic portal venous system, <br>associated with local and systemic risk factors. The clinical features A<span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>are poorly defined in the literature. The proportion that progress to <br>chronic <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and the influences of various treatments are unknown. The aim <br>was to summarize the clinical features of A<span style="color: red">PVT</span> in a Portuguese reference <br>center as well as their evolution over five years of follow-up. Methods: A <br>total of 5 A<span style="color: red">PVT</span> patients admitted in our hospital from 2008 to 2009 were <br>analyzed retrospectively. Results: A<span style="color: red">PVT</span> was diagnosed in 1 female and 4 <br>males, with a mean age of 47 years old. Most patients (n = 4) presented with <br>abdominal pain and tenderness. Only one patient had cirrhosis by the time of <br>diagnosis. A hereditary thrombofilia was detected in 2 cases, an <br>intra-abdominal infection in 1, a mieloproliferative disease in 1, and <br>nocturnal paroxistic hemoglobinuria in another one. Diagnosis was confirmed <br>by angio-CT in 3 patients (60%) and MRI in another 3 (40%). None of the <br>patients underwent thrombolysis nor thrombectomy. Four patients (80%) were <br>anticoagulated after diagnosis (warfarin). The one patient with cirrhosis <br>was not anticoagulated because of previous hemorrhagic events, and died soon <br>after. The mean duration time of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was 39 months, and was <br>effective in half of the patients (n = 4). Intestinal infarction was the <br>solo complication reported in one patient. No other patient died within the <br>period of follow-up. Conclusions: Our data reveals to be similar to that <br>found in the literature, showing the value of following the available <br>recommendations regarding diagnosis and therapeutics. It also confirms that <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy is the treatment of choice in this rare disease, <br>with real impact on long time survival.<br><br>RECORD 188<br>A case of elusive portal vein thrombus: The devil is in the detail<br>Duran J.M. Brailovsky Y. Baang J.<br>Journal of General Internal Medicine (2015) 30 SUPPL. 2 (S308). Date of <br>Publication: April 2015<br><br>LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1: Recognize idiopathic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> and know <br>the clinical and radiological findings that may mimic a gastrointestinal <br>malignancy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2: Recognize the importance of discussing <br>radiologic studies with a radiologist, especially when confronted with a <br>diagnostic dilemma. CASE: A 57-year-old Caucasian woman presented with <br>abdominal pain, and 1 week of diarrhea. The patient was found to have a <br>fever of 102, mild abdominal distention and tenderness but an otherwise <br>normal exam. She was mildly anemic with significant leukocytosis. She had a <br>recent history of recurrent Clostridium difficile colitis after taking <br>ciprofloxacin for a urinary tract infection. Upon admission she was found to <br>have a urinary tract infection and a relapse of her clostridium difficile <br>colitis. She was treated with appropriate antibiotics but her abdominal pain <br>persisted. A CT abdomen with contrast was performed which revealed a <br>mass-like lesion in the colon “concerning for metastatic colon cancer”, <br>hepatic lesions, moderate amount of ascites, thrombus in the portal and <br>intrahepatic vein and a “heterogenous mass” in the pancreatic head. <br>Suspicion for malignancy was high and the thrombus was thought to be <br>secondary to this malignancy. An aggressive GI work up including a <br>colonoscopy, diagnostic paracentesis, upper GI endoscopy with biopsy of a <br>nodular lesion in the duodenum and endoscopic ultrasound were performed, and <br>all were negative for any significant findings. The pathology of the <br>biopsied tissue was benign in nature. The patient's confusing picture <br>prompted the primary team to discuss the CT findings with a <br>hepatobiliary-imaging specialist that was not involved in the original <br>radiologic readings. It was noted that the pancreatic duct was still intact, <br>making malignancy very unlikely since this would cause destruction of the <br>pancreatic duct. It was concluded that the stranding and “heterogenous mass” <br>noted on the CT scan were secondary changes originating from the portal vein <br>thrombosis. The patient was started on <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> and was discharged <br>with significant resolution of her symptoms. DISCUSSION: Acute portal vein <br>thrombosis is a condition not infrequently encountered in the hospital. It <br>is being diagnosed more frequently mainly due to the wide availability of <br>ultrasound doppler devices. The clinical presentation of acute portal vein <br>thrombosis is broad and can be easily confused with other conditions that <br>may have similar presentations. Radiologic findings can mimic <br>cholangiocarcinoma or a pancreatic head mass. In our case there were many <br>“red herrings” that guided the team and consultants towards a diagnosis of a <br>GI malignancy. The key element in coming up with the diagnosis was an <br>additional review of our imaging study with a radiologist, also known as <br>radiology rounds. Concerns have been raised regarding the disappearance of <br>traditional radiology rounds, mainly driven by wide spread implementation of <br>PACS and teleradiology, and the impact it may have on diagnostic errors. Our <br>case exemplifies the importance of recognizing the signs and symptoms of <br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>, which canmimic GI malignancies, and the significance <br>of traditional radiology rounds, especially when confronted with a <br>diagnostic dilemma.<br><br>RECORD 189<br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> does not increase portal hypertension related bleeding, but <br>exposes patients with cirrhosis to a high risk of minor hemorrhages.

Date of Publication: April <br>2015<br><br>Background and Aims: <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) is an <br>effective and relatively safe therapy for patients with portal vein <br>thrombosis (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>). However, the haemorrhagic risk of VKAs in relation with <br>the presence of cirrhosis, has poorly been investigated Methods: We compared <br>the VKAs-related bleeding risk in cirrhotic patients with de novo <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>(<span style="color: red">PVT</span>-cohort, n = 62) vs non-cirrhotic patients with a thromboembolic event <br>(TE-cohort, n = 160). Any bleeding during four years of follow-up or up to <br>withdrawal of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy, was recorded. The quality of <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> control was measured by the time in therapeutic range (TTR) <br>of the INR. Bleeding risk due to portal hypertension (PHT) in the <span style="color: red">PVT</span>-cohort <br>was compared with an independent series of cirrhotics with PHT unexposed to <br>VKAs during follow-up (CHcohort, n = 53). Major bleeding episodes under <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> were intracranial or retroperitoneal events, fatal bleeding <br>events, need of hospitalization or transfusion, otherwise they were <br>considered minor bleedings. All patients with cirrhosis were under <br>prophylaxis for PHT-related bleeding according to current guidelines. <br>Results: TE-cohort and <span style="color: red">PVT</span>-cohort were comparable for age, sex. The mean of <br>TTR was 67.7±20.9% for the former, 70.5±19.1% for the latter (p = 0.379) but <br>treatment with VKAs was longer for the TE-cohort (31.1±16.9 vs 23.0±16.2 <br>months, p = 0.001). Overall, 41 patients under <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> experienced a <br>bleeding episode (14 major/27 minor). The actuarial probability of <br>major/minor bleedings was higher in <span style="color: red">PVT</span>-cohort (23%/30%) than in the <br>TE-cohort (6%/20%) (p < 0.001). However, the risk of upper-gastro-intestinal <br>bleeding in <span style="color: red">PVT</span>-cohort (15%) was the same as in the CH-cohort (13%) also <br>adjusting for potential confounders, confirming the lack of impact of VKAs <br>on the risk of bleeding due to PHT. Finally, the exclusion of the <br>upper-gastrointestinal bleeding in the <span style="color: red">PVT</span>-cohort led to a significant <br>reduction of major bleedings accountable for VKAs, leaving a significant <br>residual risk only for minor bleeding episodes (p < 0.05). Conclusions: VKAs <br>expose patients with cirrhosis and <span style="color: red">PVT</span> to an additional risk of minor <br>bleedings. This should be taken into account in future clinical studies to <br>ameliorate the benefit/risk ratio of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in this clinical <br>setting.<br><br>RECORD 190<br>Risk factors associated with overall and bleeding-related mortality in <br>patients with <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> on the waiting list for liver <br>transplantation<br>Iacob S.

We <br>identified 43 (40 M/3 F) patients who were diagnosed as having BCS. Their <br>outcome was evaluated between September 2012 and October 2013. Results: In <br>total, 33 patients (77%) had presented with liver-related symptoms (Group <br>I), while 10 (23%) were asymptomatic for liver disease (Group II). This <br>latter group had presented with symptoms related to the presence of major <br>vessel disease such as fever, leg swelling, or dyspnea. The site of venous <br>obstruction determined in 41 patients was inferior vena cava (IVC) and <br>hepatic veins combined in 25 (61%), IVC alone in 12 (29%), and only hepatic <br>veins in 4 patients (10%). The number of patients with concurrent <br>obstruction in the hepatic veins and the IVC was less in Group II than in <br>Group I (3/10 vs 22/31, p = 0.06). A total of 20 (19 M/1 F) patients (47%) <br>had died at a median of 10 months after diagnosis. Mortality was <br>significantly lower in Group II (10%) than in Group I (58%), (p = 0.011). By <br>the end of the survey, 23 patients were alive, of whom 21 could be <br>re-evaluated at the clinic. Conclusions: BCS associated with BS is usually <br>due to IVC thrombosis with or without hepatic vein thrombosis. Silent cases <br>exist and have a better prognosis. The mortality rate among the patients <br>symptomatic for liver disease remains high.<br><br>RECORD 193<br>Use of warfarin for the treatment of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in cirrhotic <br>patients awaiting liver transplantation<br>Butt W. Agrawal V. Rezk A. Komar M. Smith R. Khara H.S.<br>Gastroenterology (2015) 148:4 SUPPL. 1 (S1041). Date of Publication: April <br>2015<br><br>Background: Untreated <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) in cirrhotic patients <br>leads to poor pre and post liver transplant outcomes. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> prior to liver <br>transplantation is an independent prognostic factor for post-transplant <br>survival and prior studies have shown that complete or partial portal vein <br>recanalization is associated with better survival after liver <br>transplantation. Few studies have shown the safety and efficacy of low <br>molecular weight heparin in the treatment of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, however, available data <br>for the use of warfarin in this clinical setting is sparse and there are no <br>clear guidelines for target INR for this patient population. Aim: The aim of <br>our study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of warfarin for the <br>treatment of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in cirrhotic patients who underwent liver transplantation. <br>Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all cirrhotic patients <br>listed for liver transplantation from Jan 2006 to Nov 2014 at our tertiary <br>academic medical center with diagnosis of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> pretransplantation. These <br>patients were treated with warfarin therapy with a therapeutic INR target of <br>one point higher than their baseline at the time of diagnosis of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. <br>Results: A total of 86 patients underwent liver transplantation during the <br>study period. Nine patients were diagnosed with thrombosis of pre-hepatic <br>venous system, of which seven patients with <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> met our <br>inclusion criteria. None of these patients had any contraindication for <br>anti-coagulation. All study patients were males, mean age 52 years (range <br>47-59), mean BMI 29.7 (range 26.7-36.7), with underlying etiology of chronic <br>hepatitis C (n=3), or alcohol induced cirrhosis (n=1) or both (n=3). All <br>patients treated with warfarin had a mean baseline INR of 1.43 (range <br>1.1-1.92) and therapeutic goal INR was set at one point higher than the <br>baseline at the time of diagnosis of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. All patients were treated until <br>transplant with a mean duration of treatment of 11 months (range 2-20). <br>Average MELD score at the time of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> diagnosis was 24 (range 21-29). Six <br>patients achieved re-canalization prior to liver transplantation within a <br>mean time of 6 months (range 1-13). Only one patient had extension of <br>thrombus while on warfarin treatment. No significant differences were noted <br>in the occurrence of hepatic decompensation before or after the treatment. <br>There were no adverse events related to the warfarin use. There was no <br>posttransplant mortality at 1 year follow up. Conclusions: Treatment of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>in cirrhotic patients awaiting liver transplantation with warfarin using <br>therapeutic goal INR of one point higher than their baseline was safe and <br>effective in our small pilot study. This data gives insight into determining <br>the appropriate therapeutic goal INR for treatment of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> with warfarin in <br>these patients. Larger, multi-center studies should be conducted to further <br>validate these findings.<br><br>RECORD 194<br>Complications of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy<br>Fortounis K. Delivorias P. Paralikoudi D. Anastasiadou A. Makridis C.<br>Surgical Endoscopy and Other Interventional Techniques (2015) 29 SUPPL. 1 <br>(S215). Date of Publication: April 2015<br><br>Aim: The aim of our study was to examine the morbidity and mortality arising <br>from laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) as a single-stage bariatric <br>procedure. Method: 204 patients (F/M: 165/39) who underwent LSG as a <br>single-stage bariatric procedure in our Department from 2009 to 2013 were <br>retrospectively reviewed. Postoperative course, clinical presentation and <br>treatment of complications were recorded. Results: Mortality rate was zero. <br>No conversions to open operation occurred. A total complication rate of 7.3 <br>% was recorded. Staple line leak was the most frequent postoperative <br>complication, observed in 5 patients (2.4 %). Conservative treatment with <br>total parenteral nutrition and antibiotics was successful in 2 cases. <br>However, 3 patients required a combination of percutaneous drainage under CT <br>guidance, stenting and reoperation including abdominal washout, drainage and <br>establishment of a feeding jejunostomy. There were also 3 cases (1.5 %) of <br>hemorrhage (2 from the staple line and 1 from a port site) that needed <br>transfusion, 4 cases (2 %) of nutrient deficiencies (2 of vitamin B12, 1 of <br>vitamin B1 and 1 of folic acid) presented with peripheral neuropathy <br>symptoms and managed with proper supplementation, 1 case (0.5 %) of sleeve <br>stricture presented 6 months after LSG with dysphagia and vomiting that <br>required open repair with Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy, 1 case (0.5 %) of <br>superior mesenteric and <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> managed with therapeutic <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> and 1 case (0.5 %) of intraabdominal abscess, in a patient <br>under immunosuppressive therapy for rheumatoid arthritis, conservatively <br>managed with antibiotics. Conclusion: LSG is a safe surgical option as a <br>single-stage bariatric procedure, with relatively low complication rates. <br>Early diagnosis and adequate multidisciplinary management of its major <br>complications is the key for further reduction of LSG-related morbidity and <br>mortality.<br><br>RECORD 195<br>Incidence and risk factors for perioperative thromboembolic events among <br>patients with renal cell carcinoma and inferior vena cava tumor thrombus<br>Viers B. Boorjian S. Lohse C. Psutka S. Morrisson G. Leibovich B. Thompson <br>R.H.<br>Journal of Urology (2015) 193:4 SUPPL. 1 (e615). Date of Publication: April <br>2015<br><br>INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: There is a high rate of mortality among <br>patients who develop a perioperative thromboembolic (TE) event. While renal <br>cell carcinoma (RCC) will present with inferior vena cava tumor thrombus <br>(IVC-TT) in up to 10% of patients, the incidence of perioperative TE event <br>in these patients remains understudied. As such, we evaluated our experience <br>with the treatment of RCC IVC-TT to investigate the incidence and to <br>evaluate factors associated with TE diagnosis. METHODS: We reviewed 183 <br>patients with RCC IVC-TT who underwent radical nephrectomy and IVC tumor <br>thrombectomy between 2000-2010. A TE event was defined as the perioperative <br>development of a bland thrombus or embolism not related to the IVCTT. <br>TE-free, cancer-specific and overall survival were estimated using the <br>Kaplan-Meier method. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> use and TE event were analyzed as a <br>time-dependent covariate. Associations of clinicopathologic features with <br>time to TE event, cancer-specific and all-cause mortality were evaluated <br>using Cox proportional hazard regression models. RESULTS: A total of 23 <br>(13%) patients presented with a TE event at RCC diagnosis. Postoperatively, <br>55 (30%) patients developed a TE event, at a median 23 (IQR 5-146) days <br>following surgery, including 24 (13%) pulmonary emboli, 17 (9%) deep venous, <br>13 (7%) bland IVC thrombi and 1 (0.5%) <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. At a median <br>follow-up of 1.2 (IQR 0.3-4.0) years, the cumulative incidence of TE event <br>at 30, 90 and 365 days following surgery was 17%, 21% and 25%, respectively. <br>An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≥1 (HR 2.03; <br>p=0.01), hypercoagulability disorder (HR 4.66; p=0.001) and IVC ligation at <br>the time of surgery (HR 2.33; p=0.02) were associated with an increased risk <br>of TE event. Meanwhile, the development of a postoperative TE was <br>significantly associated with an increased risk of RCC-related (HR 1.74; <br>p=0.004) and all-cause mortality (HR 1.65; p=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: A TE event <br>was identified postoperatively in 30% of patients with surgically treated <br>RCC IVC-TT. While the majority of these events occur within 90 days after <br>surgery, poor functional status, hypercoagulability disorder and IVC <br>ligation were associated with higher risks of TE event.<br><br>RECORD 196<br>Safety and efficacy of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy for portal/splanchnic vein <br>thrombosis in patients with <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> on the waiting list for liver <br>transplantation<br>Gheorghe L.

Date of Publication: April <br>2015<br><br>Background and Aims: In patients with advanced cirrhosis, the presence of <br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) represents a cause of increased morbidity and <br>mortality. Despite the high frequency of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in patients with end stage <br>liver disease on the waiting list (WL) for liver transplantation (LT), there <br>are few data on the efficacy and safety of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy in this <br>setting. Therefore neither clear recommendations, nor consensus regarding <br>the optimal regimen and duration of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy have been <br>addressed in recent consensus publications on this specific issue. Aim: To <br>investigate the safety and efficacy of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy for <br>portal/splanchnic vein thrombosis in patients with <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> on the WL <br>for LT. Methods: We included 121 patients with <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> included on <br>the waiting list for LT. Results: The prevalence of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> on the National WL <br>for LT is 19.1%. Out of 121 patients, 44.6% received anticoagulant therapy. <br>35.1% received low weight heparine and 64.9% received acenocumarol for a <br>mean time of 9.4±1.4 months. 39.6% of them had recanalization of the <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, <br>while 31.4% remained stable after 3 months of anticoagulant therapy. <br>Complete and partial repermeabilization was acheived in 14.5% (7/48) and <br>85.5% (41/48) respectively. 13.2% of patients were transplanted.

Ling S. Nikfarjam M. Fink M.A. Jones R. Muralidharan V. <br>Starkey G. Christophi C.<br>ANZ journal of surgery (2015) 85:4 (270-273). Date of Publication: 1 Apr <br>2015<br><br>BACKGROUND: Portal vein resection (PVR) with pancreatectomy is now accepted <br>practice in cases with involvement by tumour. We present our experience of <br>this procedure with particular emphasis on morbidity and survival.METHODS: A <br>retrospective case-control analysis of a prospectively maintained database <br>between 2004 and 2012 was undertaken. A total of 17 patients had pancreatic <br>resections with PVR for cancer and were compared with 17 patients with <br>identical tumour type and stage who underwent pancreatic resection without <br>PVR next in chronological order. Information obtained included patient <br>demographics, radiological and histological evidence of major vein <br>involvement and post-operative morbidity. Disease- and recurrence-free <br>survival were calculated using Kaplan-Meier curves.RESULTS: Procedures <br>associated with PVR included pancreatico-duodenectomy in 11 and total <br>pancreatectomy in six. Three patients underwent pancreatic resection as a <br>re-operation. Pathological staging showed 2× T2N0, 5× T3N0, 1× T1N1, 2× T2N1 <br>and 7× T3N1 tumours. Seven PVR patients (41%) had post-operative morbidity <br>Clavien 3 and 4, compared with none in no-PVR group, but rates of Clavien 1 <br>and 2 complications were similar. Six PVR patients developed PV thrombosis <br>(35%), all with significant clinical consequences. Comparing the PVR group <br>with the no-PVR group, there was significantly reduced median overall <br>survival in (13.8 versus 43.1 months; P = 0.028) and recurrence-free <br>survival (7.5 months versus 39.7; P = 0.004).CONCLUSIONS: Survival of <br>patients after pancreatectomy with PVR was reduced and morbidity was high <br>compared with no-PVR. Delayed <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> due to recurrence was <br>common.

Liu L. Qi X. He C. Yin Z. Wu F. Fan D. Han G.<br>PLoS ONE (2015) 10:3 Article Number: e0119909. Date of Publication: 30 Mar <br>2015<br><br>Background and Aim: The coagulation abnormalities in non-cirrhotic <br>Budd-Chiari syndrome (NC-BCS) and non-cirrhotic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> <br>(NC-<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) are unclear. We conducted this case-control study to investigate <br>the coagulation profile of NC-BCS and NC-<span style="color: red">PVT</span> in Chinese patients. Methods: <br>We measured the levels of factors II, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, protein <br>C (PC), protein S (PS) and antithrombin (AT) in blood samples from 37 NC-BCS <br>patients, 74 NC-<span style="color: red">PVT</span> patients, and 100 healthy controls. The levels and <br>ratios of pro- and anti-coagulation factors were compared between patients <br>with NC-BCS and healthy controls, between different types of NC-BCS and <br>between NC-<span style="color: red">PVT</span> and healthy controls. Results: In patients with NC-BCS, <br>factor VIII (P<0.001) was significantly elevated; factor V (P<0.001), VII (P <br><0.001), IX (P = 0.003), X (P<0.001), XI (P<0.001), XII (P<0.001), PC <br>(P<0.001) and AT (P <0.001) were significantly decreased; and no difference <br>was observed for factor II (P = 0.088) and PS (P = 0.199) compared with <br>healthy controls. Factor VIII-to-PC (P = 0.008), factor VIII-to-PS (P = <br>0.037) and factor VIII-to-AT (P = 0.001) were significantly increased; other <br>ratios were significantly reduced or did not show any difference. No <br>differences were observed between different types of NC-BCS for individual <br>pro- and <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> factors or the ratios between them. Among patients <br>with NC-<span style="color: red">PVT</span>, factor VIII (P<0.001) was significantly elevated and other <br>factors were significantly decreased. Factor II-to-PC (P<0.001), factor <br>VIII-to-PC (P<0.001), factor IX-to-PC (P<0.001), factor VIII-to-PS (P< <br>0.001), factor II-to-AT (P<0.001), factor VIII-to-AT (P<0.001) and factor <br>IX-to-AT (P<0.001) were significantly increased; all other ratios for NC-<span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>were significantly reduced or did not show any significant difference. <br>Conclusions: NC-BCS and NC-<span style="color: red">PVT</span> are associated with elevated levels of factor <br>VIII and the decreased levels of PC and AT were probably the most <br>significant features of coagulation imbalance. Additionally, NC-<span style="color: red">PVT</span> was <br>associated with decreased levels of PS.<br><br>RECORD 200<br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> and arterioportal shunting due to chronic <br>cholangitis: A rare complication of living donor liver transplantation<br>Hsieh C. Chou C. Lin K. Lin C. Chen Y.<br>HPB (2015) 17 SUPPL. 2 (91-92). Date of Publication: March 2015<br><br>Objectives: The incidence of late onset <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> after living <br>donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is approximately 6% in adults and 8% in <br>children. To the best of our knowledge, <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> and <br>arterioportal shunting due to chronic cholangitis after LDLT has never been <br>reported. Methods: We present a patient with <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> due to <br>chronic cholangitis after liver donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Results: <br>A 52-year-old woman with a history of hepatitis B virus-related liver <br>cirrhosis underwent LDLT. After the surgery, the patient had recurrent <br>episodes of cholangitis due to common bile duct and intrahepatic bile duct <br>stricture. Biliary stricture due to cholangitis eventually resulted in acute <br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. A stent was inserted via percutaneous transluminal <br>portography.

Date of Publication: <br>March 2015<br><br>The prevalence of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) with cirrhosis has been <br>reported more frequently in recent years. The reported prevalence of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is <br>in the range of 0.6 ∼ 15.8 % in patient with <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> or portal <br>hypertension. If the patient has hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC), thrombus is <br>likely to be malignant thrombus. Malignancy, frequently of hepatic origin, <br>are responsible for 21 ∼ 24 % of overall cases. The overall mortality rate <br>of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> has been reported to be less than 10 %, but is increased to 26 % when <br>associated with HCC and cirrhosis. Because actually it is not easy to <br>distinguish between malignant thrombus and benign thrombus in clinical <br>aspect, <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in HCC are still debatable whether or not treatment when it <br>diagnosed. Many studies have been made to distinguish malignant <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and <br>benign <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Fine needle biopsy of the thrombus has the potential of <br>clarifying the nature of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Tarantino et al. noted a sensitivity of only <br>76 % for portal vein sampling in determining malignancy. Clinically, benign <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span> was imaging documentation of at least 12 months of stability, and rapid <br>progressive thrombi (within 3 months) despite adequate <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>therapy were considered malignant.

Date of Publication: March 2015<br><br>Introduction: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is a rare complication of total <br>pancreatectomy with autologous islet transplantation (TPIAT). Little is <br>reported about the risk factors, consequences, or treatment for this <br>complication. Methods: A retrospective review and analysis of a <br>prospectively-collected database of patients undergoing TPIAT from March <br>2009 to August 2014 was conducted. Two-tailed t-tests were used comparing <br>continuous data and Fisher's exact test comparing categorical data. Results: <br>135 patients (102 women,76%) underwent TPIAT; Nine(7%) had <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. All patients <br>with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> were women. There were no differences in age or islet equivalents <br>transplanted in patients with and without <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Mean BMI of patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>was lower than those without (21.8 vs 26.5 kg/m2,p = 0.03).Mean portal <br>pressure post-islet infusion was higher in patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> (25.2 vs 16.0,p <br>= 0.0007), with 4/9 having pressures over 30 mmHg. The median time to <br>diagnosis of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was 10.5 days postoperative(range 7 to 210),with 7/9 having <br>negative duplex POD1.

Date of Publication: March 2015<br><br>Introduction: The NanoKnife® irreversible electroporation system (IRE) uses <br>electrical energy to destroy neoplastic tissue invading surrounding <br>neurovascular structures. Large scale IRE for pancreatic cancer has yet to <br>be reported. This study examines a large cohort of IRE-treated pancreatic <br>cancer patients to evaluate the safety of this novel surgical approach. <br>Methods: Data was abstracted on all T3 and T4 pancreatic cancer patients who <br>underwent IRE at a tertiary hepatobiliary unit from 2012-2014. Standard <br>statistical methodology was used. Results: 50 consecutive patients were <br>treated with IRE by 3 pancreatic surgeons, with 36(72%) cases performed by a <br>single surgeon. Mean patient age was 65.8 ± 7.8 years, with 31(62%) male <br>patients. There were 45(90%) adenocarcinoma cases, most commonly involving <br>the pancreatic head (n = 16;32%) or body (n = 16;32%). IRE was used for <br>primary local control in 25(50%) cases and margin ablation in 21(42%). <br>Median survival was 11.8 ± 6.2 months. Median follow-up was 7.8 ± 9.6 <br>months, with length of stay 7.34 ± 5.6 days and readmission rate of 20%(n = <br>10). 30- and 90-day complication rates were 36%(n = 18) and 6%(n = 3), most <br>commonly <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>(n = 4;8%), intraabdominal collection(n = <br>3;6%), and anemia requiring transfusion(n = 3;6%). Overall mortality <br>attributable to IRE was 6%(n = 3). 3 additional mortalities were related to <br>disease progression. Conclusions: IRE offers a feasible technique to manage <br>advanced pancreatic cancer. To reduce morbidity and mortality, <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> should be considered when performing IRE near the portal <br>vein, and plastic stenting should be considered when performing IRE near the <br>common bile duct. IRE is a potentially crucial tool in the arsenal of <br>surgeons treating otherwise inoperable pancreatic cancer.

Date of Publication: <br>March 2015<br><br>Background: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is a complication of cirrhosis that <br>reduces the hepatic reserve and causes variceal bleeding. In Japan, the <br>efficacy of danaparoid sodium (Orgaran®), a hepa-rinoid anti-coagulation <br>factor Xa, therapy (DS) for <span style="color: red">PVT</span> has been reported. Methods: We <br>retrospectively analyzed 41 hospitalized cirrhotic patients: 16 hepatitis C <br>virus, 5 hepatitis B virus, 20 others; the model for end-stage liver disease <br>(MELD) score 8.6 ± 4.7; platelets 80 ± 40 9 10[SUP]3[/SUP]/μL; 3 esophageal <br>varices F0, 16 F1, 5 F2, 0 F3, and 17 unknown. DS 2500 units were <br>administered daily (n = 41, mean duration: 9.5 days), followed by oral <br>warfarin (prothrombin time-international normalized ratio: 1.5 ± 0.3) in <br>outpatient clinic (n = 16, 25.8 weeks). The volume of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>V) measured <br>with a three-dimensional-image analyzer (SYNAPSE VINCENT®, n = 28), serum <br>D-dimer (n = 29), and scinti-graphic portal shunt indices (normal, ≤ 10 %; n <br>= 6) were monitored. Results: Thrombi formed at one site in 25 patients (18 <br>portal, 4 superior mesenteric, and 3 splenic veins) and at two or more sites <br>in 16. At the end of DS, the <span style="color: red">PVT</span>V decreased to 55.1 ± 40.2 % of baseline <br>(8.6 ± 10.3 cm[SUP]3[/SUP], P<0.0001), D-dimer decreased from 11.8 ± 12.6 <br>μg/mL to 7.0 ± 7.4 μg/mL (P = 0.007), and the shunt indices decreased from <br>62.4 ± 10.5 % to 56.9 ± 7.1 % (P = 0.250). During DS, Grade 2 <br>intraperitoneal bleeding occurred in one patient (2.4 %). During follow-up, <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span>V increased in 33.3 % of the patients, MELD score in-creased in 37.5 %, <br>platelets decreased in 50.0 %, and varices grade increased in 18.2 %. <br>Conclusions: <span style="color: red">PVT</span> could be resolved with DS with relative safety.

Bui J.T. Knuttinen M. Minocha J. Ray Jr. C.E. Gaba R.C.<br>Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2015) 26:2 SUPPL. 1 (S96). <br>Date of Publication: February 2015<br><br>Purpose: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>)-with or without splenic vein (SVT) or <br>superior mesenteric vein (MVT) thrombosis- is a <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> complication <br>with potentially devastating implications, including intestinal <br>ischemia/infarction, portal hypertensive variceal hemorrhage, and <br>technically challenging liver transplantation. By improving portal venous <br>flow dynamics, TIPS can enable <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, SVT, and MVT clearance and may prevent <br>deleterious outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of TIPS in <br>clearing <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and associated thrombosis. Materials and Methods: In this <br>single-center, IRB-approved retrospective study, 16 patients underwent TIPS <br>from 2008- 2014 for <span style="color: red">PVT</span> as a primary (n=9) or secondary (n=7) indication. <br>TIPS were not accompanied by pharmacomechanical clot disruption; rather, <br>shunts served to increase portal blood flow to allow flow-mediated <br>physiologic clot dissolution. Four patients with inadequate follow-up were <br>excluded. Preand post-TIPS cross-sectional imaging were used to assess clot <br>location, size, and degree of occlusion, with attention to resolution <br>(vessel patency with no clot in previously occluded veins), reduction <br>(decrease in clot size), stability (no change in clot size), or extension <br>(increase in clot size). Results: The cohort included 5 men and 7 women <br>(mean age 61 years). Thrombus was non-occlusive and asymptomatic in all <br>cases, and spanned main <span style="color: red">PVT</span> (n=9), intrahepatic <span style="color: red">PVT</span> (n=5), SVT (n=6), and <br>MVT (n=8). TIPS were created with 10 mm covered stents; mean final <br>portosystemic pressure gradient was 8 mm Hg. At mean 190 days post-TIPS, 67% <br>(n=8) had clot resolution, 25% (n=3) had clot reduction, and 8% (n=1) had <br>stable clot; there were no cases of clot extension. Resolution rate was 67% <br>for <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and SVT, and 75% for MVT. Of note, 3/12 (25%) patients underwent <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> during the post-TIPS period (warfarin for deep vein <br>thrombosis in 2, dalteparin for cardiac thrombus in 1); all 3 patients had <br>clot resolution. Two of 12 (17%) patients underwent successful liver <br>transplant post-TIPS. Conclusion: TIPS effectively dissolves or decreases <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span>, SVT, and MVT in cirrhotic patients.

To illustrate the application of transjugular <br>intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) creation for treatment of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> 5. To <br>summarize technical and clinical outcomes of TIPS for treatment of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>Background: <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is a relatively common occurrence in patients with liver <br>cirrhosis, and may result in significant morbidity. Not only can this <br>condition lead to complications such as mesenteric ischemia, portal <br>hypertension with variceal bleeding, and portal cholangiopathy, but this <br>entity can also negatively impact liver transplantation by both increasing <br>operative complexity and diminishing post-surgical survival. Systemic <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> is the current mainstay of therapy for <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, but has limited <br>capacity to spur portal venous recanalization, and its use may be limited in <br>patients with variceal bleeding risk. Emerging data suggests that TIPS, by <br>enhancing portal venous blood flow velocity and providing portal venous <br>access for clot disruption and/or thrombolysis, may effectively clear portal <br>venous clot and thereby potentially benefit patients with portal vein <br>thrombosis. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: This exhibit will review <br>relevant aspects of patient selection as well as TIPS procedure technique <br>and approaches (including flow-enhanced clot dispersal, thrombolytic agent <br>assisted dissolution, direct mechanical disruption, maceration, and/or <br>aspiration, and stent muralization or recanalization), with depiction using <br>case examples.

Date of Publication: February 2015<br><br>Purpose: The aim of this study is to test our hypothesis that the <br>trans-splenic (TS) route can be employed as an alternate approach for portal <br>vein recanalization-transjugular portosystemic shunts (PVR-TIPS) for chronic <br>main <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (m<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) in potential transplant candidates. <br>Materials and Methods: With IRB approval, 11 consecutive patients with <br>cirrhosis-induced chronic m<span style="color: red">PVT</span> underwent transsplenic PVR-TIPS in 2013-2014. <br>All patients were denied listing by our transplant team due to the presence <br>of m<span style="color: red">PVT</span>, a relative contraindication at our center. Patients were followed <br>for adverse events. PV patency at follow-up was assessed by 1-month <br>splenoportography and subsequently by ultrasound/MRI every 3 months. <br>Following PVR-TIPS, patients were reviewed (and subsequently listed) at <br>weekly multidisciplinary conference. Results: PVR-TIPS using the TS approach <br>was successful in all 11 patients with no major complications. Median age <br>was 61 years (range: 33-67), 9/11 (82%) were male, and nonalcoholic <br>steatohepatitis / hepatitis C were the leading causes of liver disease <br>(8/11, 4 each). Complete m<span style="color: red">PVT</span> was found in 8/ 11 (73%) patients. Four out of <br>11 patients (36%) had a MELD >18 and 8/11 (73%) had a baseline Child-Pugh <br>score 7-10. Minor adverse events occurred in 2/11 (fever, encephalopathy). <br>Five out of eleven patients (45%) exhibited some minor remaining thrombus in <br>the PV at the end of the procedure; of these patients, 3/5 had complete <br>thrombus resolution at one month, with the remaining 2/5 resolving at 3 <br>months (no <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>).

Date of <br>Publication: 1 Feb 2015<br><br>Summary Background Portal vein obstruction may be due to portal vein <br>thrombosis (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) or its sequale, the portal cavernoma. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is a common <br>complication in <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span>, however, it may also occur as a primary <br>vascular disorder, in absence of any liver disease. Aim To review the <br>current knowledge on nomenclature, etiology, pathophysiology, clinical <br>presentation, diagnostic workup and management of adult patients with <br>obstruction in the portal vein, either as a primary vascular disease in <br>adults, or as a complication of <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span>. Methods A structured search <br>in PubMed was performed using defined keywords (portal vein obstruction, <br>extra-hepatic portal vein obstruction, <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and portal cavernoma), including <br>full text articles and abstracts in English language. Results Several <br>causes, operating both at local and systemic level, might play an important <br>role in the pathogenesis of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Frequently, more than one risk factor could <br>be identified; however, occasionally no single factor is discernible. <br>Diagnosis of portal vein obstruction depends on clinical presentation, <br>imaging and laboratory investigations. Prompt treatment greatly affects the <br>patient's outcome. Conclusions Portal vein obstruction occurring either due <br>to thrombosis in the portal vein or due to the portal cavernoma, can <br>contribute to significant morbidity and mortality in patients with or <br>without cirrhosis. In recent years our understanding of etio-pathogenesis of <br>portal vein obstruction has evolved tremendously, which has led to <br>significant improvement in treatment outcomes. There are still areas where <br>more studies are needed to better clarify the management issues of portal <br>vein obstruction.<br><br>RECORD 211<br>Early joint application of anticoagulant drugs to prevent portal vein <br>thrombosis after splenectomy and devascularisation<br>Zheng C.-L.

METHODS: One hundr <br>ed and twent y - eight patients with portal hypertension who underwent <br>splenectomy and devascularization were included, including 28 patients with <br>early application of low molecular heparin calcium (heparin group), 42 with <br>joint application of low molecular heparin calcium and low molecular dextran <br>(joint group), and 58 without the use of anticoagulant drugs (control <br>group). The rate of postoperative thrombosis, postoperative platelet count, <br>and prothrombin time (PT) were compared among the three groups. The indexes <br>of portal vein blood flow were also recorded.

Data regarding the safety of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>continuation/cessation after GIB are limited. We sought to determine the <br>safety and risk of continuation of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> after GIB. METHODS: We <br>conducted a prospective observational cohort study on consecutive patients <br>admitted to the hospital who had GIB while on systemic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. <br>Patients were classified into two groups at hospital discharge after GIB: <br>those who resumed <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> and those who had <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>discontinued. Patients in both groups were contacted by phone 90 days after <br>discharge to determine the following outcomes: (i) thromboembolic events, <br>(ii) hospital readmissions related to GIB, and (iii) mortality. Univariate <br>and multivariate Cox proportional hazards were used to determine factors <br>associated with thrombotic events, rebleeding, and death. RESULTS: We <br>identified 197 patients who developed GIB while on systemic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>(n=145, 74% on warfarin).

During the follow-up period, 7 (4%) patients <br>suffered a thrombotic event and 27 (14%) patients were readmitted for GIB. <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> continuation was independently associated on multivariate <br>regression with a lower risk of major thrombotic episodes within 90 days <br>(hazard ratio (HR)=0.121, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.006-0.812, P=0.03). <br>Patients with any malignancy at time of GIB had an increased risk of <br>thromboembolism in follow-up (HR=6.1, 95% CI=1.18-28.3, P=0.03). <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> continuation at discharge was not significantly associated <br>with an increased risk of recurrent GIB at 90 days (HR=2.17, 95% <br>CI=0.861-6.67, P=0.10) or death within 90 days (HR=0.632, 95% CI=0.216-1.89, <br>P=0.40). CONCLUSIONS: Restarting <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> at discharge after GIB was <br>associated with fewer thromboembolic events without a significantly <br>increased risk of recurrent GIB at 90 days.

This is why <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy (AT) is now frequently used in these patients. <br>Variceal bleeding is a severe complication of LC. It is unknown whether AT <br>may impact the outcome of bleeding in these patients. Fifty-two patients on <br>AT with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) were evaluated. Portal vein <br>thrombosis (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) and different cardiovascular disorders (CVDs) were the <br>indication for AT in 14 and 38 patients, respectively. Overall, 104 patients <br>with LC and UGIB not under AT matched for severity of LC, age, sex, source <br>of bleeding, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score served as <br>controls. UGIB was attributed to portal hypertension (PH) in 99 (63%) <br>patients and peptic/vascular lesions in 57 (37%). Twenty-six (17%) patients <br>experienced 5-day failure; SOFA, source of UGIB, and <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, but not AT, were <br>independent predictors of 5-day failure. In addition, independent predictors <br>of 6-week mortality, which was observed in 26 (11%) patients, were SOFA, <br>Charlson Comorbidity index, and use of AT for a CVD. There were no <br>differences between patients with/without AT in needs for rescue therapies, <br>intensive care unit admission, transfusions, and hospital stay.

Date of Publication: 2015<br><br>Abstract Introduction We report a patient with a rapidly progressing <br>recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with a portal vein tumor <br>thrombus after radiofrequency ablation of the original lesion, then treated <br>with transcatheter arterial infusion. Radical hepatic resection demonstrated <br>a complete pathological response. Presentation of case A 60-year old male <br>with alcoholic cirrhosis and gastric varices was diagnosed with HCC <br>measuring 12 mm in segment 8. He underwent laparoscopic radiofrequency <br>ablation, but recurred three months later. The lesion progressed rapidly and <br>the right portal vein was occluded. He then underwent transcatheter arterial <br>infusion with miriplatin and iodized oil, which was effective in reducing <br>the size of the main lesion and portal vein tumor thrombus. Right anterior <br>sectionectomy was then performed. Pathologically, there were no viable HCC <br>cells in either the main lesion or the portal vein thrombus. He is alive two <br>years and nine months after surgery without recurrence. Discussion A rapidly <br>progressing HCC recurrence with portal vein tumor thrombus is usually <br>associated with a poor prognosis. No effective treatments have been reported <br>in this situation except hepatic resection. In this patient the tumor was <br>effectively reduced after three courses of transarterial miriplatin and <br>subsequent radical hepatic resection. This is the first report to achieve a <br>complete pathological response for such an aggressive recurrence after <br>initial radiofrequency ablation. Conclusion This strategy may result in <br>long-term survival of patients with rapidly progressing recurrent HCC with <br>portal vein thrombus, and further study is warranted.<br><br>RECORD 219<br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in Patients with Cirrhosis—Etiology, Diagnosis, and <br>Management<br>Intagliata N.M.

Date of Publication: 2015<br><br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is one of the most common vascular disorders of <br>the liver with significant morbidity and mortality. Large cohort studies <br>have reported a global prevalence of 1%, but in some risk groups it can be <br>up to 26%. Causes of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> are cirrhosis, hepatobiliary malignancy, abdominal <br>infectious or inflammatory diseases, and myeloproliferative disorders. Most <br>patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> have a general risk factor. The natural history of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>results in portal hypertension leading to splenomegaly and the formation of <br>portosystemic collateral blood vessels and esophageal, gastric, duodenal, <br>and jejunal varices. Diagnosis of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is made by imaging, mainly Doppler <br>ultrasonography. According to its time of development, localization, <br>pathophysiology, and evolution, <span style="color: red">PVT</span> should be classified in every patient. <br>Some clinical features such as cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and <br>hepatic transplantation are areas of special interest and are discussed in <br>this review. The goal of treatment of acute <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is to reconstruct the <br>blocked veins. Endoscopic variceal ligation is safe and highly effective in <br>patients with variceal bleeding caused by chronic <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. In conclusion, <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is <br>the most common cause of vascular disease of the liver and its prevalence <br>has being increasing, especially among patients with an underlying liver <br>disease.

Methods The PubMed, <br>EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and ScienceDirect databases were searched. The <br>rates of bleeding complications and portal vein recanalization in patients <br>who received anticoagulant therapy were pooled. The odds ratio (OR) with 95% <br>confidence interval (CI) was calculated to express the difference in the <br>rate of portal vein recanalization between <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> and <br>non-<span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> groups. All meta-analyses were conducted by using a <br>random-effects model. Results Sixteen of 960 initially identified papers <br>were included. Two studies reported a low incidence of major <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>-related complications (4% [2/55] and 3% [1/33]), but no <br>lethal complications occurred. The rate of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>-related bleeding <br>ranged from 0% to 18% with a pooled rate of 3.3% (95% CI = 1.1%-6.7%). The <br>heterogeneity was not significant in the meta-analysis. The total rate of <br>portal vein recanalization ranged from 37% to 93% with a pooled rate of <br>66.6% (95% CI = 54.7%-77.6%). The rate of complete portal vein <br>recanalization ranged from 0% to 75% with a pooled rate of 41.5% (95% CI = <br>29.2%-54.5%). However, the heterogeneity was significant in the 2 <br>meta-analyses. The rate of complete portal vein recanalization was <br>significantly higher in <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> group than in non-<span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>group (OR = 4.16, 95% CI = 1.88-9.20, P = 0.0004).

Date of Publication: 1 Sep <br>2015<br><br>IMPORTANCE: Little information is available on the long-term clinical <br>outcome of patients with splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT). OBJECTIVE: To <br>assess the incidence rates of bleeding, thrombotic events, and mortality in <br>a large international cohort of patients with SVT. DESIGN, SETTING, AND <br>PARTICIPANTS: A prospective cohort study was conducted beginning May 2,2008, <br>and completed January 30,2014, at hospital-based centers specialized in the <br>management of thromboembolic disorders; a 2-year follow-up period was <br>completed January 30, 2014, and data analysis was conducted from July 1, <br>2014, to February 28, 2015. Participants included 604 consecutive patients <br>with objectively diagnosed SVT; there were no exclusion critieria. <br>Information was gathered on baseline characteristics, risk factors, and <br>antithrombotic treatment. Clinical outcomes during the follow-up period were <br>documented and reviewed by a central adjudication committee. MAIN OUTCOMES <br>AND MEASURES: Major bleeding, defined according to the International Society <br>on Thrombosis and Hemostasis; bleeding requiring hospitalization; thrombotic <br>events, including venous and arterial thrombosis; and all-cause mortality. <br>RESULTS: Of the 604 patients (median age, 54 years; 62.6% males), 21 (3.5%) <br>did not complete follow-up. The most common risk factors for SVT were liver <br>cirrhosis (167 of 600 patients [27.8%]) and solid cancer (136 of 600 <br>[22.7%]); the most common sites of thrombosis were the portal vein (465 of <br>604 [77.0%]) and the mesenteric veins (266 of 604 [44.0%]). <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>was administered to 465 patients in the entire cohort (77.0%) with a mean <br>duration of 13.9 months; 175 of the anticoagulant group (37.6%) received <br>parenteral treatment only, and 290 patients (62.4%) were receiving vitamin K <br>antagonists. The incidence rates (reported with 95% CIs) were 3.8 per 100 <br>patient-years (2.7-5.2) for major bleeding, 7.3 per 100 patient-years <br>(5.8-9.3) for thrombotic events, and 10.3 per 100 patient-years (8.5-12.5) <br>for all-cause mortality. During anticoagulant treatment, these rates were <br>3.9 per 100 patient-years (2.6-6.0) for major bleeding and 5.6 per 100 <br>patient-years (3.9-8.0) for thrombotic events. After treatment <br>discontinuation, rates were 1.0 per 100 patient-years (0.3-4.2) and 10.5 per <br>100 patient-years (6.8-16.3), respectively. The highest rates of major <br>bleeding and thrombotic events during the whole study period were observed <br>in patients with cirrhosis (10.0 per 100 patient-years [6.6-15.1] and 11.3 <br>per 100 patient-years [7.7-16.8], respectively); the lowest rates were in <br>patients with SVT secondary to transient risk factors (0.5 per 100 <br>patient-years [0.1-3.7] and 3.2 per 100 patient-years [1.4-7.0], <br>respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Most patients with SVT have a <br>substantial long-term risk of thrombotic events. In patients with cirrhosis, <br>this risk must be balanced against a similarly high risk of major bleeding. <br>Anticoagulant treatment appears to be safe and effective in most patients <br>with SVT.<br><br>RECORD 232<br>Pretransplant portal vein recanalization-transjugular intrahepatic <br>portosystemic shunt in patients with complete obliterative portal vein <br>thrombosis<br>Salem R.

Date of Publication: 23 Oct 2015<br><br>Background.Chronic, obliterative portal vein (PV) thrombosis (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) <br>represents a relative contraindication to liver transplantation (LT) in some <br>centers. When PV thromboembolectomy is not feasible, alternative techniques <br>(portacaval hemitransposition, portal arterialization, multivisceral <br>transplantation) are associated with suboptimal outcomes. In cases where a <br>chronically thrombosed PV has become obliterated, we developed PV <br>recanalization (PVR)-transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) to <br>potentiate LT.We evaluated the impact of PVR-TIPS on liver function, <br>transplant eligibility, and long-termoutcomes after LT. Methods. Forty-four <br>patients with chronic obliterative main <span style="color: red">PVT</span>were identified during our <br>institutional LTselection committee. After joint imaging review by <br>transplant surgery/radiology, these patients underwent PVR-TIPS to <br>potentiate transplant eligibility.

The <br>TIPS venography and serial ultrasound/MRI were used subsequently to document <br>PV patency. Results.

Laboratory studies <br>indicate that the net effect of changes in hemostasis in many patients with <br>chronic liver disease is a hypercoagulable status.

Materials and Methods In 2013-2014, 11 consecutive patients with <br>cirrhosis-induced chronic main <span style="color: red">PVT</span> underwent transsplenic PVR-TIPS. All <br>patients had been denied listing for transplant because of the presence of <br>main <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, a relative contraindication in this center. The patients were <br>followed for adverse events. Portal vein patency was assessed at 1 month by <br>splenoportography and every 3 months subsequently by ultrasound or magnetic <br>resonance imaging. After PVR-TIPS, patients were reviewed (and subsequently <br>listed for transplant) at a weekly multidisciplinary conference. Results <br>PVR-TIPS using the transsplenic approach was successful in all 11 patients <br>with no major complications. Median age was 61 years (range, 33-67 y) and 9 <br>of 11 patients (82%) were men. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis was the leading <br>cause of liver disease in 4 of 11 patients (36%), and hepatitis C was <br>present in 4 of 11 patients (36%). Complete main <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was found in 8 of 11 <br>patients (73%). Of 11 patients, 4 (36%) had a Model for End-Stage Liver <br>Disease score > 18, and 8 (73%) had a baseline Child-Pugh score of 7-10. <br>Minor adverse events occurred in 2 of 11 patients (fever, encephalopathy). <br>At the end of the procedure, 5 of 11 patients (45%) exhibited some minor <br>remaining thrombus in the portal vein; 3 of the 5 patients (60%) had <br>complete thrombus resolution at 1 month, with the remaining 2 patients <br>having resolution at 3 months (no <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was needed).

Date of Publication: 30 Aug 2015<br><br>Objective: To evaluate the parietal peritoneum (PP) as an autologous <br>substitute for venous reconstruction during hepatopancreatobiliary (HPB) <br>surgery. Background: Venous resection during liver or pancreatic resection <br>may require a rapidly available substitute especially when the need for <br>venous resection is unforeseen. Methods: The PP was used as an autologous <br>substitute during complex liver and pancreatic resections. Postoperative <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was standard and venous patency was assessed by routine <br>computed tomographic scans. Results: Thirty patients underwent vascular <br>resection during pancreatic (n = 18) or liver (n = 12) resection, mainly for <br>malignant tumors (n = 29). Venous resection was an emergency procedure in 4 <br>patients due to prolonged vascular occlusion. The PP, with a mean length of <br>22 mm (15-70), was quickly harvested and used as a lateral (n = 28) or a <br>tubular (n = 2) substitute for reconstruction of the mesentericoportal vein <br>(n = 24), vena cava (n = 3), or hepatic vein (n = 3). Severe morbidity <br>included Clavien grade-III complications in 4 (13%) patients but there was <br>no PP-related or hemorrhagic complications. Histological vascular invasion <br>was present in 18 (62%) patients, and all had an R0 resection (100%). After <br>a mean follow-up of 14 (7-33) months, all venous reconstructions were patent <br>except for 1 tubular graft (97%). Conclusions: A PP can be safely used as a <br>lateral patch for venous reconstruction during HPB surgery; this could help <br>reduce reluctance to perform vascular resection when oncologically required. <br>Clinical trials identification: NCT02121886.<br><br>RECORD 244<br>Operative interventions for extrahepatic portomesenteric venous aneurysms <br>and long-term outcomes<br>Fleming M.D. Lall P.

The optimum management of these <br>patients is unknown. Methods Consecutive patients with PVA were identified <br>over an 18-year period (1992-2010). A retrospective review was conducted. <br>Clinical presentation, modality of diagnosis, surgical treatment, 30-day <br>morbidity and mortality, and follow-up are reported. Results Four patients <br>were identified who underwent surgical management of an extrahepatic PVA. <br>Operative technique using left renal vein, femoral vein panel graft, <br>polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft, and segmental aneurysm wall resected <br>with aneurysmorrhaphy is described. Early complications occurred in 1 <br>patient with an ePTFE graft. The patient returned to the operating room for <br>bleeding. In addition, the same patient had a late graft thrombosis 6 years <br>postoperatively when the <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was discontinued for pregnancy. The <br>remainder of the patients recovered without complication, and their repairs <br>are still patent with a mean follow-up of 78 months (17-144 months).

Date of Publication: 2015<br><br>BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is no longer viewed as an isolated dermatological <br>ailment and instead is considered a systemic disease. The extension of this <br>spectrum has heightened the known risk of morbidity and mortality due to the <br>involvement of cardiovascular system and the risk of venous thrombosis. A <br>number of cases have reported the increased occurrence of deep vein <br>thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in the background of psoriasis, however <br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> has not been reported to date. We report an index <br>case of chronic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in a diagnosed patient with <br>psoriasis.CASE PRESENTATION: A 67-year-old South-Asian female previously <br>diagnosed and treated for psoriasis presented with a four month history of <br>abdominal pain associated with abdominal distension. Clinical examination <br>revealed an enlarged spleen and free fluid in the abdomen. Imaging with <br>ultrasonography and computed tomography of the abdomen revealed features <br>compatible with chronic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> with cavernous <br>transformation.CONCLUSION: This case highlights the importance of having <br>clinical awareness of occurrence of thrombosis in patients with psoriasis. <br>Typical symptoms favoring thrombosis should prompt thorough investigation to <br>exclude this rare yet possible complication in patients with psoriasis, <br>including that of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>.

Date of <br>Publication: 2015<br><br>Venous thromboembolism that occurs in unusual sites is challenging because <br>of the potential severity of presentation, the presence of some major <br>provoking risk factors, the high prevalence of potential contraindications <br>to antithrombotic therapies, the lack of solid evidence to guide therapeutic <br>decisions, and because of the severity of long-term consequences. For <br>example, venous thrombosis in the splanchnic veins frequently occurs in <br>patients with <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span>. Not uncommonly, these patients present with <br>concomitant active gastrointestinal bleeding, and/or low platelet count or <br>oesophageal varices. If inadequately treated, splanchnic vein thrombosis <br>(SVT) may further worsen portal hypertension and, thus, increase the <br>long-term risk of bleeding. Up to 40 % of patients with cerebral vein <br>thrombosis (CVT) have signs of intracranial bleeding at the time of the <br>diagnosis. This finding is associated with worst prognosis in terms of death <br>or severe disability. Despite the apparent presence of a major <br>contraindication to <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, only a timely administration of <br>parenteral anticoagulant drugs may improve this unfavourable outcome.

Erythropoietin-independent colonies (EEC) were evaluated in 111 SVT <br>pts and found in 80 (72%), accounting for 38/48 PV (79%), 31/44 ET (70.5%), <br>9/12 PMF (75%) and 2/7 U-MPN (28.6%). At dg, SVT PV pts had lower hemoglobin <br>levels than Ctr: median was 17.4 g/dL vs 18.5 g/dL (p<0.0001) in male, 16.9 <br>g/dL vs 17.7 g/dL (p=0.0006) in female. A co-existing thrombophilic status <br>was found in 38.5% SVT vs 11.8% of Ctr (p<0.0001). Recurrent SVT occurred in <br>12.2% of pts with a rate of 1.6% person/year (CI 1.2-2.1); risk of venous <br>thrombosis other than SVT was increased in SVT group vs Ctr (p=0.02), with <br>no difference for arterial thrombosis. Hemorrhage was more frequent in SVT <br>group (32%) vs Ctr (7.2%)(p<0.0001), mainly related to esophageal varices, <br>which were present in 66.9% of SVT pts. There was no difference in evolution <br>to MF and acute leukemia (AL) for PV and ET pts with and w/o SVT, while risk <br>of AL was lower in MF with SVT (p<0.00001). Overall survival was shorter in <br>ET pts with SVT vs Ctr (p<0.0001). In PMF survival was better in SVT group <br>(p<0.00001) and was associated with a higher proportion of SVT pts in lowest <br>risk categories: IPSS low 65%, intermediate-1 20%, intermediate-2 10% and <br>high 5% compared with 15%, 34%, 25% and 26% in Ctr group. At last FU, 79/519 <br>pts (15.2%) had died; causes of death were evolution to AL (15.4%), other <br>cancers (13.8%), disease progression without AL (10.8%), SVT (10.8%), <br>hepatic failure and venous thrombosis other than SVT (7.7% each), heart <br>failure and arterial thrombosis (6.2% each), hemorrhage (5.5%), renal <br>failure and infection (4.6% each). Therapy after SVT included <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in 77%, antiaggregant in 21.2% and combination in 1.8%; 70% <br>received cytotoxic drugs; 12.4% were treated with transjugular <br>porto-systemic shunt. Beta blocker therapy was used in 48.5% of pts and <br>correlated with improved survival (p=0.041) MPN associated with SVT <br>correlated with younger age and female sex and might antedate the clinical <br>phenotype in a quarter of the patients. MPN-associated SVT equally affected <br>PV and ET, was more likely to occur in the presence of JAK2V617F or <br>underlying thrombophilia and predicted recurrent venous but not arterial <br>thrombosis. The apparent association of SVT with better or worse prognosis <br>in PMF and ET, respectively, requires further investigation.<br><br>RECORD 249<br>Long-term complications after splenectomy in adult chronic immune <br>thrombocytopenia with a minimum follow up of 10 years.

Godeau B.<br>Blood (2014) 124:21. Date of Publication: 6 Dec 2014<br><br>Introduction: Splenectomy was historically regarded as the gold standard for <br>treatment in chronic adult immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). However, <br>the recent emergence of new drugs has deeply modified ITP management and <br>splenectomy is no longer viewed as an unavoidable step in adult chronic ITP <br>in many countries. The estimation of the risk over benefit of this potential <br>curative treatment remains challenging both for patients and physicians. A <br>retrospective Italian study focused on long-term outcome of patients <br>splenectomized for ITP gave reassuring data concerning safety. A recent <br>study from a large cohort of American veterans showed an increased risk of <br>death due to septicemia, pulmonary embolism, coronary artery disease and <br>cancer more than 10 years after splenectomy. We reported here the results of <br>the first single center case-control study evaluating the long-term <br>incidence of splenectomy complications with a minimum follow-up of 10 years. <br>Methods: We retrospectively selected in a clinical computer database all <br>primary ITP patients splenectomized more than 10 years ago in our unit. We <br>matched 1 by 1 to non-splenectomized ITP patients based on date and age at <br>ITP diagnosis and sex criteria. Clinical data were then completed from <br>medical charts. All patients were interviewed by phone and a standardized <br>questionnaire was used. Medical records from general practitioner or from <br>Medical care center have been systematically obtained if necessary, <br>especially for deceased patients. Comparison between groups were made using <br>Fisher's test for qualitative variables, Kaplan-Meier method to estimate <br>incidence and Rank test for comparison of cumulative incidence, with p<0.05 <br>defining significance. Results: Seventy splenectomized ITP patients were <br>included (19men/51women) with a median age at ITP diagnosis of 37 years <br>(range: 3-92). Sixty one (87%) initially responded to splenectomy but only <br>34(48.5%) maintained a sustained response after a median follow-up of 189 <br>months (range:120-528). Matched non-splenectomized ITP patients had a median <br>age at diagnosis of 40 years (range: 3-93) and a median follow-up since ITP <br>diagnosis of 197 months (range: 96-504).Cumulative incidence of <br>thromboembolic events was higher in the splenectomized group (p=0.029) <br>(Figure1). Four (6%) episodes of post-operative <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> were <br>observed, 3 were complicated by portal cavernoma requiring long-term <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. They tended to present with more thromboembolic events on a <br>long-term (n=7) than non-splenectomized ITP patients (n=3, p=0.113). Two <br>splenectomized (2.8%) and 1 non-splenectomized (1.4%) patients were <br>diagnosed with post-embolic pulmonary arterial hypertension. The incidence <br>of cardiovascular events was significantly higher in splenectomized group <br>(9(13%) versus 2(2.8%), p=0.005) (Figure 2) with 6 transient and/or ischemic <br>strokes in splenectomized patients (none in non-splenectomized).Infectious <br>events were similar in the two groups (splenectomized: 12 (17%) vs 10 (14%)) <br>but infections were more frequent and severe in splenectomized patients. <br>Indeed, 12 splenectomized patients presented 20 infectious events requiring <br>hospitalization, 13 of them were pneumonia (Streptococcus Pneumoniae: n=4, <br>Haemophilus Influenzae: n=1, undocumented: n=9). Five complicated <br>septic-shocks leading to 3 deaths. In non-splenectomized group, 10 patients <br>had 10 infectious events (Pneumonia n=4, Streptococcus Pneumoniae n=1), 7 <br>were hospitalized, none had septic-hock. Incidence of cancer was similar in <br>the 2 groups (splenectomized: 11 (16%), non-splenectomized: 10 <br>(14%).Finally, the mortality rate was not different between two groups <br>(splenectomized: n=14 (20%), non-splenectomized n=9, 13%). Ten (38%) of the <br>36 non-responders patients deceased, 7 from hemorrhage and/or septic shock. <br>Other splenectomized and non-splenectomized patients died from malignant <br>cancer/hemopathy (n=5), coronary artery disease (n=2), other (n=6). <br>Conclusion: Based on this case control single center study, we observed that <br>long-term splenectomized patients have not only an increase risk of <br>life-threatening infections, but also an increased risk of thromboembolic, <br>and cardiovascular events. A long-term follow-up is therefore recommended in <br>this patient population regardless the status of ITP in order to better <br>prevent and manage such complications.<br><br>RECORD 250<br>Management of incidental splanchnic vein thrombosis in cancer patients<br>Kreuziger L.B.

Date of Publication: November 2014<br><br>Objectives: To assess the prevalence and clinical outcomes of Hepatitis B <br>(HBV) patients co-infected with Human Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV) in a <br>tertiary care hospital. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional study was <br>performed, of HBV positive HIV infected patients following HAART therapy <br>from 2007 to 2012 in Infectious disease Unit, Hospital Palau Pinang (HPP), <br>Malaysia. The demographic and clinical data of the patients was collected <br>retrospectively. The collected data was analyzed with SPSS software (Version <br>20) to measure the correlation of variables and their infection rates. <br>Results: A total of 664 HIV infected patients including 495 (74.5%) males <br>and 169 (25.5%) females with mean age of 40 ± 10.35 years were included in <br>present study. Of these, 86 (13%) were co-infected with HBV. The main race <br>involved in current study was Chinese 455 (68.5%) followed by Indians 88 <br>(13.3%), Malay 83 (12.5%) and minorities 38 (5.7%). The route of <br>transmission was mainly male heterosexual contact 464 (69.9%) followed by <br>homosexual 47(7.1%) and Intra- Venous Drug Users (IVDU) 48 (7.2%). The mean <br>CD4 count, ALT and AST levels in HBV-HIV co-infected patients were 385 ± <br>148.55, 51.48 ± 39.42, 105.581 ± 38.37 respectively. The co-infection is <br>significantly associated with gender (p = 0.05), and IVDU (p = 0.01).

The clinical and demographic data was collected from <br>patient's records. In present study we analyzed the collected data by using <br>SPSS software (Version 20) to determine the correlation of variables and <br>measure their infection rates in a particular population. Results: The study <br>involves a total of 708 HIV infected patients with the mean age of 40 ± <br>10.17 years together with 541(76.4%) males and 167(23.6%) females. There <br>were 130(18.4%) patients co-infected with HCV. The assigned population <br>involve in current study was Chinese 427(60.3%) followed by Indians <br>96(13.6%), Malay 151(21.3%) and minorities 34 (4.8%).

Date of Publication: <br>10 Oct 2014<br><br>Introduction: Predictors of successful <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy for the <br>treatment of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) in cirrhosis are yet unknown. Aim: <br>To assess the hemostatic status, as well as patient and thrombus <br>characteristics, as predictors of therapeutic efficacy. Materials and <br>methods: We evaluated 57 cirrhotics with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> treated with LMWH for 1 year or <br>until portal vein (PV) recanalization. The interval between <span style="color: red">PVT</span> onset and <br>start of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was estimated. All cases were characterized in <br>terms of severity of liver disease, extension of<span style="color: red">PVT</span>to other splanchnic <br>vessels, occlusion grade, platelet number, and dosing of pro- and <br>anti-coagulation factors, with calculation of factor VIII/Protein C ratio. <br>PV recanalization was evaluated every two months using abdominal ultrasound, <br>and every 3 months by CT scan, or every 2 months when ultrasound was not <br>diagnostic. Results: Median age was 59 years (range 30-83), males 41/57, <br>median MELD score was 12 (range 6-31). Etiology of cirrhosis was viral 44% <br>and alcohol-related in 38%. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was partial in 44/57 patients. <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was started within 6 months of estimated thrombus onset in <br>43/57 patients (75.4%). At 1 year, the recanalization rate was 38/57 (66.7%) <br>patients (25 complete) after a median of 4.0 months (range 1-12 months). At <br>multivariate analysis, Child Classes B/C vs A (OR 0.09; 95% CI 0.01-0.61, p <br>< .01), interval between thrombus onset and start of therapy ≥6 months (OR <br>0.03; 95% CI 0.1-0.28, p < .01), and total vs partial occlusion (OR 0.22; <br>95% CI 0.04-1.14, p < .01) correlated negatively with the probability of <br>response to <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy. Using these 3 variables, we developed a <br>score with a high ability (AUC = 0.84) to predict <span style="color: red">PVT</span> recanalization (range <br>0-11 points). Conclusions: Both PV thrombus and patient characteristics, but <br>not hemostatic status, correlate with the efficacy of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>.

Date of Publication: <br>10 Oct 2014<br><br>Background and aim: Studies which explores the hypercoagulable induced by <br>HCC in cirrhosis are lacking. The aim of the present study was to evaluate <br>the thrombophilic role of HCC as risk factor for development of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. <br>Methods: Cirrhotic patients with and without HCC were prospectively enrolled <br>in the study and underwent: thromboelastometry (ROTEM), platelet count, <br>determination of prothrombin time and of levels of pro and <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>factors. During followup, <span style="color: red">PVT</span> onset in both patients with and without HCC <br>was recorded. Results: 76 cirrhotics, 41 with HCC, were included. Volume of <br>active HCC was >5cm3 in 18 patients. Levels of pro and <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>factors were similar between patients with and without HCC, but fibrinogen <br>was increased in HCC patients with active volume >5cm3 HCC compared to those <br>with <5cm3 HCC bulk (348.72 mg/dL±124.06 mg/dL vs 237.64 mg/dL±99.18 mg/dL) <br>and to cirrhotics without HCC (260.57 mg/dL±126.07 mg/dL) (p = 0.006). <br>Platelet count was significantly increased in HCC compared to non-HCC <br>patients, and this was especially true in Child A group. ROTEM demonstrated <br>a significantly lower clotting time and maximum clot formation in HCC <br>patients compared to controls and non-HCC cirrhotics, especially in Child A <br>group. The incidence of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was 24.4% (10/41) and 11.4% (4/35) in HCC and <br>non-HCC patients, respectively. At Cox multivariate analysis HCC and <br>fibrinogen test of ROTEM were independently associated with risk of <br>developing <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. In the HCC group, 5/10 portal vein thromboses occurred in <br>patients in Child Class A. At FIBTEM test of ROTEM, MCF and AUC were <br>statistically greater in HCC patients who later developed <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Conclusions: <br>Cirrhotics with HCC demonstrate a prothrombotic hemostatic balance resulting <br>in an increased risk of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> development. This prothrombotic state seems to <br>be detectable by ROTEM and thus possibly suggest those who could benefit <br>from thromboprophylaxis.<br><br>RECORD 255<br>Characteristics of splanchnic veins thrombosis: A multicenter community <br>hospitals study<br>Sherid M.

Date of <br>Publication: October 2014<br><br>Introduction: Splanchnic veins thrombosis (SVT) (mesenteric, portal & <br>hepatic veins) is rare in general population, but is common in certain <br>conditions (cirrhosis, pancreatitis and IBD). The clinical features, <br>etiology, and outcomes are Different among these conditions. The aim of the <br>study was to provide 7-year outcomes of SVT in our institutions. Medical <br>records of patients with SVT from Jan. 2007-May 2014 reviewed. The study was <br>conducted in 2 community hospitals after IRB approval with collaboration <br>with GRU. ICD-9 codes were used to identify cases. The demographic details, <br>clinical features, imaging findings, comorbidities, treatment and mortality <br>were collected. The initial search identified 85 cases of these 3 entities; <br>however after careful reviewing, most were excluded due to less specific <br>ICD-9. Finally, only 5 cases were identified. We found 4 with acute <br>mesenteric vein thrombosis (3 female). The precipitating factors were <br>antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, unresectable pancreatic cancer, recent <br>colectomy for colon cancer and end-stage liver disease. All 4 had abdominal <br>pain of 1-3 days before admission & nausea in 3 patients. The patient with <br>colectomy also had rectal bleeding & peritoneal signs. All cases were <br>identified on CT scan showing thrombosis in superior mesenteric vein (SMV) <br>in 3 cases and SMV occlusion by pancreatic mass in the 4th case. In the case <br>of colectomy, the CT scan showed infarction of the ileum requiring emergent <br>surgery. Two cases were treated with therapeutic dose of heparin. Long term <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> with warfarin & aspirin was instituted only in the <br>antiphospholipid patient. Both cases of unresectable pancreatic cancer and <br>endstage cirrhosis died during follow up period of 42 and 254 days after the <br>thrombotic events. The other 2 were followed for 2,214 and 1,893 days <br>without adverse events (until the day of entering the data) and they had <br>patent SMV on repeated CT scan. Additionally, we had an 86-year-old female <br>with <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in association with essential thrombocytosis. <br>She presented 1 week after surgery for small bowel obstruction. CT scan <br>showed thrombosis of left portal vein & superior mesenteric artery (SMA), <br>infarction in left hepatic lobe and spleen, small bowel inflammatory changes <br>and perforation, amd changes of acalculus cholecystitis requiring emergent <br>surgery. She was placed on therapeutic dose of heparin followed by warfarin <br>& aspirin. The patient recovered uneventfully. A repeat CT scan after 11 <br>days showed patent portal vein and SMA. She was followed for 949 days and <br>had no adverse events. There were no cases of hepatic vein thrombosis during <br>the study period. In this study, SVT occurred rarely (only 5 cases) during <br>our 7-year study period.

Houry M. Lattimer L. Kumar A. Borum M.<br>American Journal of Gastroenterology (2014) 109 SUPPL. 2 (S343). Date of <br>Publication: October 2014<br><br>Introduction: Patients that present with abdominal pain and normal initial <br>laboratory evaluation and imaging studies can be challenging to diagnose. <br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is a rare cause of abdominal pain, particularly <br>in non-cirrhotic patients. One autopsy study showed <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in 1% of a Swedish <br>population. Of that 1%, only 14% were considered “idiopathic,” with the <br>majority related to cirrhosis or malignancy. We present a case of subacute <br>abdominal pain that was found to be due to a splanchnic venous thrombus in a <br>non-cirrhotic patient. A 67-year-old female with past medical history <br>significant for hypertension presented with 2 weeks of epigastric pain that <br>worsened post-prandially and radiated to her back. There was no associated <br>nausea, vomiting, or change in bowel habits. On exam, she was afebrile with <br>a pulse of 85 and mildly hypertensive at 151/77. Her abdomen was soft , but <br>had decreased bowel sounds and tenderness over the epigastrium. Her initial <br>laboratory tests were notable for a leukocytosis of 22,000, normal chemistry <br>panel, normal liver enzymes (AST 37, ALT 28), lactate 1.8, and lipase 101. <br>An abdominal ultrasound showed no abnormalities. Abdominal CT demonstrated a <br>thrombus of her portal vein extending to the splenic vein and down into her <br>superior mesenteric vein. She was started on therapeutic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>with unfractionated heparin, but had no improvement in her pain or clot <br>burden after 3 days of therapy. She underwent thrombectomy and thrombolysis <br>with resolution of her symptoms. She was discharged on therapeutic low <br>molecular weight heparin and was subsequently diagnosed with <br>antiphospholipid syndrome, requiring life-long <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. This is an <br>unusual case of a patient presenting with mesenteric ischemic related to <br>venous thrombus from antiphospholipid syndrome. Our patient had subacute, <br>moderately severe abdominal discomfort related to mesenteric ischemia from <br>venous thrombosis. Venous thrombosis accounts for only 5% of all cases of <br>mesenteric ischemia. Notably, splanchnic thrombosis involving the mesenteric <br>venous system is significantly more likely to present with pain and/or <br>infarction than thrombus involving the portal vein alone. All patients with <br>splanchnic thrombosis must undergo a thrombophilia evaluation, including an <br>assessment for antiphospoholipid syndrome. Our case underscores the need to <br>consider extraluminal etiologies of abdominal pain, particularly those that <br>require urgent intervention.<br><br>RECORD 257<br>Pylephlebitis with pyogenic liver abscesses: A rare complication of <br>pancreatitis<br>Al-Hamid H.

Laboratory values included WBC 10.5, hematocrit 23.6, lipase <br>31, alkaline phosphatase 144, and normal hepatic transaminases. <br>Contrast-enhanced computerized tomography scan of the abdomen showed acute <br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> with multiple low-density lesions within the liver, <br>suggestive of abscesses. Blood cultures grew the anaerobic bacteria <br>Eubacterium aerofaciens. The diagnosis of infective suppurative thrombosis <br>of the portal vein was rendered. Parenteral antibiotics and <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>were initiated. CT-guided drainage of the largest liver abscess was <br>performed, and cultures grew Streptococcus viridans. She showed progressive <br>clinical improvement and she was successfully transitioned to outpatient <br>care. Discussion: Portal vein pylephlebitis is very rare and usually <br>presents with nonspecific clinical and laboratory findings. Pancreatitis is <br>an uncommon etiology. Hepatic abscesses can complicate severe cases. The <br>prothrombotic effect of the underlying infectious or inflammatory process is <br>the main proposed mechanism.

In 50 patients with follow-up imaging tests, portal <br>vein recanalization(PVR) was noted in 50%(25)(Partial-13, total-12). Median <br>follow-up(FU) 10(0- 376) months. Mortality at end FU 25/65(39%). VB at <br>diagnosis of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was noted in 45%(29) patients. Patients with VB were <br>significantly older (63±9.3 vs 54±12.1, p=0.003) and had lower Hb levels <br>(9.3±2.3 vs 10.8±2.2g/dL, p=0.01) compared to NVB. VB was more frequent in <br>women than in men (65% vs 34%, OR 3.6, 95% CI1.24-10.5, p=0.02) There were <br>no significant differences in etiology and severity of cirrhosis, type and <br>extent of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in VB and NVB patients. Patients with VB were less likely to <br>receive anticoagulant therapy (OR 0.24 95%CI 0.069-0.84, p=0.03). A trend <br>for lower PVR rates was observed in patients with VB at diagnosis of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>compared to NVB (25% vs 50%, p=0,069) By Cox and logistic regression <br>analysis, there were no differences in mortality at end of FU (p=0.24) and <br>at 1 year (p=0.42) between VB and NVB. Interestingly, mortality in patients <br>with VB was lower at 3 years compared to NVB (0R 0.17, 95% CI 0.04-0.75, <br>p=0.03). Kaplan Meier survival analysis showed that mortality in patients <br>with VB at <span style="color: red">PVT</span> diagnosis did not differ significantly from that in NVB or <br>controls without <span style="color: red">PVT</span>.

Chatterji M. Chacko K. Schiano T.D. Chang C.Y.<br>Hepatology (2014) 60 SUPPL. 1 (381A). Date of Publication: October 2014<br><br>BACKGROUND: The incidence and natural history of acute portal vein <br>thrombosis (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) in cirrhotic patients is poorly understood. We performed a <br>case control study of cirrhotic patients listed for liver transplantation <br>(LT) at Mount Sinai Medical Center to determine the: 1) incidence of new <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>in cirrhotics awaiting LT, 2) natural history of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, and 3) risk factors <br>for poor clinical outcome in cirrhotics who develop <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. METHODS: A <br>retrospective chart review of patients listed for LT between Jan 1, 2002 and <br>Dec 31, 2011 was performed. Subjects with new <span style="color: red">PVT</span> (defined as <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in a <br>patient whose prior imaging showed patent PV) were identified via review of <br>radiology, operative and explant pathology reports. Diagnosis, partial vs <br>complete <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, segmental (sPV) vs main (MPV) <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and radiologic outcome <br>(resolution, progression) of cases were confirmed through blinded review by <br>a radiologist. Cirrhotic controls without <span style="color: red">PVT</span> were matched (2:1) for age and <br>time on the waitlist. Imaging and clinical outcomes (death on the waitlist, <br>transplantation) were assessed. RESULTS: 1,761 patients were listed for LT <br>between 2002-2011. 1,148 cases were excluded for reasons including HCC <br>(n=739), chronic <span style="color: red">PVT</span> (n=26), <span style="color: red">PVT</span> prior to listing (n=77), and prior TIPS <br>(n=59). We identified 20 cases of new <span style="color: red">PVT</span> on imaging and 8 cases of <br>incidental <span style="color: red">PVT</span> found at the time of LT. Incidence of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was 4.6% over 10 <br>years. No patients received <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. Most of the imaging cases <br>involved MPV only (n=10) or MPV + sPV (n=7) and 3 involved sPV only (n=3). <br>14 had follow-up imaging, of which there were 4 (28%) cases of progression, <br>7 (50%) cases of no change, and 3 (21%) cases of improvement, recanalization <br>or cavernous transformation. There were 11 deaths on the waitlist (55% <br>mortality rate) among <span style="color: red">PVT</span> cases. Median time between <span style="color: red">PVT</span> diagnosis and death <br>was 133 days. Development of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> while on the waitlist was associated with <br>an increased risk for death (OR 3.44, p=0.03) compared to controls. A <br>significantly increased risk for death while waiting was observed in <br>patients with any involvement of the main PV (OR 6.73, p=0.002) or complete <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span> (OR 10.33, p=0.003), but not in those with only s<span style="color: red">PVT</span> (OR 2.36, p=0.49) <br>or partial <span style="color: red">PVT</span> (OR 3.37, p=0.08) compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: The <br>development of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in cirrhotic patients awaiting LT is associated with a <br>high mortality rate. Spontaneous improvement of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is uncommon. Patients <br>with cirrhosis who develop main <span style="color: red">PVT</span> or complete <span style="color: red">PVT</span> warrant consideration <br>for intervention trials using <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>.

Methods: <br>Retrospective cohort study of 621 adult LT recipients (University of <br>Alberta, London Health Sciences Centre) between 01/2002-12/2012. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was <br>identified in 147 (24%) patients and 474 (76%) non <span style="color: red">PVT</span> patients served as <br>controls. Cox survival analysis was performed to determine independent <br>associations with overall mortality. Results: Demographic factors (mean age <br>53, 69% male) were similar between groups. There were also no differences in <br>mean MELD (<span style="color: red">PVT</span> 19 vs. controls 19, p=0.9) and Child Pugh scores (10 vs. 10, <br>p=0.9) on the day of LT. Donor factors (mean DRI:1.6 vs. 1.5, p=0.2) were <br>similar. Using Cox multivariable survival analysis, covariates independently <br>associated with overall mortality included Age (adjusted Hazard ratio ∼ aHR <br>1.02, p=0.015) and requiring ICU support pre-LT (aHR 2.17, p=0.006), but not <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span> (p=0.67). 5-year survival was similar between <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and controls (75%,p= <br>0.8). In comparing <span style="color: red">PVT</span> patients who did not survive (n=32) with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>survivors (n=115), non-survivors (n=32) were more likely to have complete <br>thrombus occlusion (38% vs. 13%, p=0.027) and hepatofugal flow (31% vs. 13%, <br>p=0.08). Non-survivors were more likely require thrombectomy (69 vs. 31%, <br>p=0.08) and develop reocclusion post-LT (16% vs. 3%, p=0.024). <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> rates were similar between groups. Conclusion: Well-selected <br>LT patients who had <span style="color: red">PVT</span> prior to LT have similar post-LT outcomes with <br>controls when adjusting for donor and recipient factors. Subgroups of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> LT <br>patients who did worse post-LT (complete thrombosis pre-LT, thrombectomy at <br>LT and reocclusion post-LT) warrant closer evaluation in listing and <br>management post-LT.

Date of <br>Publication: October 2014<br><br>Introduction and aims: Familial Mediterranean fever is a rare genetic <br>autoinflammatory disease with recurrent fever and inflammation.Various <br>neurological manifestations have been reported in the literature, but <br>cerebral venous thrombosis has never been described. Methods and results <br>(case description): A 23-year-old male patient visited our emergency <br>department on August 27, 2013, with the chief complaint of right arm <br>weakness. He had many previous episodes of recurrent fever and arthralgia <br>since childhood, and had been diagnosed as familial Mediterranean fever with <br>MEFV gene identification. One year ago, he experienced portal vein <br>thrombosis, which was improved with <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. Initial brain CT <br>revealed bilateral multiple intracranial hemorrhages along the superior <br>sagittal sinus, more severe in left. Severe thrombocytopenia was also <br>noticed, probably due to the splenomegaly which was previously diagnosed. <br>Under the impression of superior sagittal sinus thrombosis, MR and catheter <br>venography was performed, which showed complete obliteration of superior <br>sagittal sinus. Intravenous <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> with high dose heparin soon <br>started, but activated partial thromboplastin time was not promptly <br>prolonged, and his status rapidly progressed with brain swelling despite <br>intracranial pressure lowering treatment. Seizure followed and more <br>intracranial hemorrhages developed in follow-up brain CT. He was sentenced <br>to brain death after 3 days, and expired 1 week later.

Date of Publication: October 2014<br><br>Background and aim: studies which explore the hypercoagulable state <br>associated with neoplastic disease and its correlation with the risk of <br>developing <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in patients with HCC are lacking. The aim of the present <br>study was to evaluate the thrombophilic role of HCC in cirrhotics with and <br>without HCC and in controls and to correlate the presence of HCC and the <br>coagulation profile with the incidence of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Methods: cirrhotic patients <br>with and without HCC were prospectively enrolled in the study. Age- and <br>sex-matched healthy individuals constituted the control group for <br>thromboelastometry (ROTEM). All cirrhotic patients with and without HCC <br>underwent: ROTEM, platelet count, determination of prothrombin time and of <br>levels of pro and <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> factors. During follow-up, <span style="color: red">PVT</span> onset in <br>both patients with and without HCC was recorded. Results: 76 cirrhotics, 41 <br>with HCC and 35 without HCC, were included. Forty-eight healthy volunteers <br>were included as the control group. Volume of active HCC was >5 cm3 in 18 <br>patients. Levels of pro and <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> factors were similar between <br>patients with and without HCC, but fibrinogen was increased in HCC patients <br>with active volume >5cm3 HCC compared to those with <5cm3HCC bulk <br>(348,72mg/dL±124,06mg/ dL vs 237,64mg/dL±99,18mg/dL) and to cirrhotics <br>without HCC (260,57mg/dL±126,07mg/dL) (p=0,006). Platelet count was <br>significantly increased in HCC patients compared to non- HCC patients, and <br>this was especially true in Child Class A subjects. Patients with HCC showed <br>significantly lower clotting formation time (CFT) and maximum clot formation <br>(MCF) at ROTEM compared to healthy controls. The hypercoagulable state was <br>present even when HCC patients were compared to cirrhotics without HCC, and <br>was more evident when performing a subgroup analysis of Child Class A <br>patients, with statistically significant differences in MCF EXTEM, MCF NATEM <br>e CFT NATEM. During the 12 months follow-up there were 14 <span style="color: red">PVT</span> episodes (10 <br>in HCC and 4 in non HCC group). At Cox multivariate analysis HCC and <br>fibrinogen test of ROTEM were independently associated with risk of <br>developing <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. In the HCC group, 5/10 <span style="color: red">PVT</span> occurred in patients in Child <br>Class A. At FIBTEM test of ROTEM, MCF and AUC were statistically greater in <br>HCC patients who later developed <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Conclusions: cirrhotics with HCC <br>demonstrate a prothrombotic hemostatic balance resulting in an increased <br>risk of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> development. ROTEM seems to be a sensitive method to identify <br>hypercoagulability, that would otherwise be undetected by routine laboratory <br>testing. This prothrombotic state seems to be detectable by ROTEM and thus <br>possibly suggest those who could benefit from thromboprophylaxis.<br><br>RECORD 264<br>Imbalance of pro-vs. Anti-coagulation factors in Chinese patients with <br>Budd-Chiari syndrome and non-cirrhotic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span><br>Chen H.

To explore these <br>coagulation imbalances and other associated influential factors, we <br>conducted a case-control study. Methods We measured the levels of factors <br>II, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, protein C (PC), protein S (PS) and <br>antithrombin (AT) in blood samples from 37 NC-BCS patients, 98 NC-<span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>patients, and 100 healthy controls. Results Compared with healthy controls, <br>factor VIII was significantly elevated; factor II, V, VII, X, XI, XII, PC <br>and AT were significantly decreased for both NC-BCS and NC-<span style="color: red">PVT</span>; no <br>differences were observed for PS of NC-BCS and for factor IX and PS of <br>NC-<span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Factor VIII-to-PC and factor VIII-to-AT were significantly increased <br>for both NC-BCS and NC-<span style="color: red">PVT</span>; factor VIII-to-PS was only significantly <br>increased for NC-<span style="color: red">PVT</span>; other ratios either significantly reduced or did not <br>show any difference. No differences were observed for pro- and <br>anti-coagulation factors or the ratios between them for different types of <br>NC-BCS. Almost no coagulation factors had a moderate correlation with liver <br>function for NC-BCS and NC-<span style="color: red">PVT</span>. For correlations between coagulation factors <br>and spleen size or platelet count, nearly no associations were observed for <br>NC-BCS, and there were some correlations for NC-<span style="color: red">PVT</span>.

Jafri S.-M. Prushani A. Schwartz S. Moonka D.<br>American Journal of Gastroenterology (2014) 109 SUPPL. 2 (S360). Date of <br>Publication: October 2014<br><br>Introduction: Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) develops in up to 50% of patients <br>with decompensated cirrhosis. Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous <br>obliteration (BRTO) has been shown to be effective in controlling gastric <br>variceal bleeding. We describe a case of BRTO for treatment of refractory <br>hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Case Report: We describe here a 71-year-old <br>woman with past medical history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, likely secondary <br>to NASH, COPD on home oxygen, and coronary artery disease, who had recurrent <br>admissions for HE despite standard of care treatment. The patient was not a <br>transplant candidate because of her cardiac and pulmonary comorbidities. <br>From June 2012 to June 2013, she had 12 admissions for hepatic <br>encephalopathy. No precipitating factors were initially identified. A <br>non-occlusive <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> was found in July 2012. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>was initiated without change. The patient continued to suffer from repeated <br>bouts of HE despite medical therapy. Abdominal cross-sectional imaging <br>identified a large splenorenal shunt. She underwent a balloon retrograde <br>transvenous obliteration of a splenorenal shunt in June 2013, and had marked <br>reversal of encephalopathy. At 12 months' follow-up, she had no recurrence <br>of her HE. MELD score decreased slightly in spite of intervention. <br>Discussion: HE can be precipitated by noncompliance, infection, <br>gastrointestinal bleeding, medications, over diuresis, or other inciting <br>factors. All patients should be evaluated for secondary triggers of HE. <br>Treatment should be initiated with a non-absorbable disaccharide (ie, <br>lactulose). Rifaximin can be added in patients not responding to lactulose. <br>Most patients improve after correction of precipitants and medical therapy. <br>Large portosystemic shunts may be embolized in patients with medically <br>refractory, recurrent, or severe HE. The BRTO procedure is performed often <br>in Asia for the management of gastric varices. BRTO has advantages over TIPS <br>in that it is less invasive and can be performed on patients with poor <br>hepatic reserve and those with encephalopathy. We describe an unusual case <br>of the use of this therapeutic modality for the successful management of <br>hepatic encephalopathy due to a splenorenal shunt. Conclusion: Refractory <br>hepatic encephalopathy is difficult to manage, particularly in patients who <br>are not transplant candidates. BRTO is a technique that can be used to <br>effectively treat HE by occluding large mesenteric-systemic shunts without <br>sacrificing hepatic function. We describe a patient in whom BRTO was an <br>effective technique to treat her refractory hepatic encephalopathy caused by <br>a splenorenal shunt.<br><br>RECORD 266<br>Successful treatment of partial <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) with low dose <br>rivaroxaban<br>Lenz K.

Al Mardini N. Agrawal K.<br>American Journal of Gastroenterology (2014) 109 SUPPL. 2 (S176). Date of <br>Publication: October 2014<br><br>Case Report: This is a 70-year-old female who presented with right upper <br>quadrant abdominal pain. On computerized tomography, a large right hepatic <br>lobe mass extending directly into the portal vein was identified. MRI <br>abdomen confirmed the extension of thrombosis into the right portal vein. <br>Alphafetoprotein was elevated at 62,148 ng/mL. Liver biopsy was done later <br>and showed findings consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma. Although she <br>had Child-Pugh class A, she declined radioembolization and systemic <br>treatment, so she enrolled in hospice. The patient didn't receive <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>.During the following 4 months, the patient improved <br>clinically with alleviation of her abdominal pain. She revoked hospice and <br>had CT scan abdomen done, which showed spontaneous regression of her liver <br>mass. Her Alpha-fetoprotein decreased significantly to 2448.24 ng/mL. Two <br>months later, the patient continues to do well. The patient did not receive <br>any forms of liver cancer treatments. This is a likely case of <br>selfembolization of the hepatocellular carcinoma leading to spontaneous <br>regression. Discussion: Advanced stages of hepatocellular carcinoma carry <br>very poor prognosis. <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in hepatocellular carcinoma is <br>associated with poor prognosis as it limits the blood supply to normal liver <br>parenchyma. However, we postulate that in some rare cases like ours, tumor <br>thrombosis can cause self-embolization of the tumor itself. The other <br>alternative explanation for the spontaneous regression of the tumor could be <br>that the immune system was able to control the tumor growth. We present this <br>rare case of self-embolization of hepatocellular carcinoma to highlight the <br>importance of follow-up patients while they are on hospice to detect <br>potential regression in the tumor burden, differentiating between bland and <br>tumor thrombosis to guide the <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy and the need for <br>further studies in this subject to develop further treatment options and <br>predict the prognosis of similar hepatocellular carcinomas.<br><br>RECORD 268<br>A multicenter survey of the efficacy and safety of danaparoid sodium <br>treatment for <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span><br>Ohtake T.

Date of Publication: October 2014<br><br>[Background and aim] As a complication of cirrhosis, <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> <br>(<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is a critical condition that worsens hepatic reserve function. The <br>standard treatment is <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy with unfractionated heparin, <br>low-molecular-weight heparin, or warfarin. Danaparoid sodium (DS) is a <br>heparinoid anticoagulant. Here we retrospectively report the efficacy and <br>safety of DS in the treatment of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. [Methods] This is a retrospective <br>epidemiological study analyzing integrated clinical data of patients treated <br>with DS for <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Six facilities in Hokkaido, Japan participated in this <br>study. Patients with firsttime treatment from register data were included. <br>Patient personal information was protected by the anonymizing method. <br>[Results] Eighty-five patients [51 males, 34 females; median age, 66 years <br>(35-85)] were analyzed. Thrombosis sites were the following: portal trunk <br>only, 28 cases; portal trunk with intrahepatic branches, 17; mainly <br>intrahepatic branches 36; and principal tributaries only (superior <br>mesenteric vein or splenic vein), 4. The complications observed were liver <br>cirrhosis in 65% cases. The etiology was HBV-associated in 17 cases, <br>HCV-associated in 21, alcoholic liver disease in 17 both viral and alcohol <br>in 4, autoimmune in 7, NASH-related in 4, and others in 15. Complication <br>rate of hepatocellular carcinoma was 39%; furthermore, 47% patients were <br>treated for esophageal varices. Child-Pugh class of patients was A in 41 and <br>B + C in 44 cases. The duration of DS therapy was median 14 days (4-150). <br>Total dose of DS was median 37,500 units (5,000-255,000). Therapeutic <br>efficacy was complete resolution of thrombosis, 39%; residual thrombosis <br><50%, 33%; residual thrombosis ≥50%, 6%; unchanged 19%; and unknown, 3%. <br>Univariate analysis revealed higher serum ammonia levels as a predictive <br>factor of therapeutic efficacy of DS in clinical background and blood test <br>before treatment. In addition, higher dosage of DS tended to have <br>therapeutic efficacy. Two of 85 patients had adverse events: one had <br>bleeding from esophageal ulcer after endoscopic variceal ligation and the <br>other had thrombocytopenia. In the mean observation period of 747 days, 54 <br>patients survived and 31 died. The efficacy of DS therapy and no <br>complication of HCC contributed to the cumulative survival by Kaplan-Meier <br>curve (p = 0.036 and 0.007, respectively). [Conclusions] In all, 72% <br>patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> treated with DS had complete resolution of thrombosis or <br><50% residual thrombosis. No serious adverse events were observed. Efficacy <br>of DS therapy contributed to the cumulative survival.

Methods: A consecutive 26 cirrhotic patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> were <br>enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. The etiologies of cirrhosis <br>were hepatitis B virus-related, hepatitis C virus-related, alcoholic and <br>cryptogenic in five, 14, three and four patients, respectively. Child-Pugh <br>grade A, B and C was noted in 13, eight and five patients, respectively. <br>Patients were treated with 2 weeks' administration of danaparoid sodium <br>followed by the evaluation of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> reduction and adverse events. Results: All <br>patients experienced reduction of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> through the treatment. The median <br>volume of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> before and after treatment was 2.40cm(3) (range, 0.18-16.63) <br>and 0.37cm(3) (range, 0-5.74), respectively. The median reduction rate of <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span> volume was 77.3% (range, 18-100%). According to the reduction rate, <br>complete reduction (CR), partial reduction (PR, ≥50%) and stable disease <br>(SD, <50%) were observed in four (15%), 16 (62%) and six patients (23%), <br>respectively. The median volume of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> before treatment was significantly <br>different between CR+PR and SD (2.09 vs 4.35cm(3), P=0.045). No severe <br>adverse events such as bleeding symptoms (e.g. gastrointestinal bleeding and <br>cerebral hemorrhage) and thrombocytopenia were encountered. Conclusion: <br>Danaparoid sodium for the treatment of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in patients with <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> <br>was safe and effective.

Date of Publication: September 2014<br><br>Learning Objectives 1. To review the aetiology of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> 2. <br>To describe the methods in chronic portomesenteric vein thrombosis <br>recanalisation 3. To compare the results of medical and endovascular therapy <br>in acute <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> Portal vein (PV) obstruction (PVO) is a <br>relatively rare condition, which may have serious consequences (1,2). The <br>most common cause is PV thrombosis. PV thrombosis in children is frequently <br>caused by umbilical vein catheterization with secondary infection, and less <br>frequently parasitosis. In adults, PV thrombosis is most frequent in <br>patients with cirrhosis, but may be secondary to coagulation disorders, <br>malignancy, infection, inflammatory diseases, external compression, or a <br>combination of these entities. Esophageal varices may appear as soon as 1 <br>month after the first symptoms of PV thrombosis (3). Idiopathic PVO may also <br>be present (4). PVO may be either prehepatic or intrahepatic, include both <br>localizations, or extend to more peripheral branches. Prehepatic occlusion <br>is usually secondary to acute or chronic thrombosis or to malignant disease. <br>Diagnosis is usually established using ultrasonography, computed tomography, <br>or magnetic resonance tomography. Multiple collaterals as in cavernous <br>transformation of PV or gastrointestinal, mesenteric, or subcutaneous <br>varices may be detected on these examinations. If the intrahepatic PV <br>branches are patent, the pressure gradient between these branches and the <br>systemic circulation is low. In chronic PVO, pressure gradient between <br>intrahepatic and open part of PV may be relatively low if the patient has <br>welldeveloped collaterals. If only the splenic vein is obstructed with <br>elevated pressure gradient, the condition is called “left-sided portal <br>hypertension.” In case of acute PVO, the patient presents with symptoms of <br>abdominal disorder with or without gastrointestinal bleeding. In case of <br>chronic PVO, symptoms may be more diffuse and often include ascites, <br>splenomegaly, chronic abdominal pain, and/or intermittent gastrointestinal <br>bleeding. Asymptomatic PVO may be found accidentally and in most cases, does <br>not require further attention. Depending on the severity of symptoms, <br>anticoagulant therapy, endoscopic sclerotherapy, or tapping of ascites may <br>be necessary. Surgical treatment methods include splenectomy, mesosystemic <br>shunts, bowel resection, and liver transplant. Percutaneous interventional <br>radiological (IR) options include the following (5): • Intraarterial <br>thrombolytic therapy • Intraportal thrombolysis • Removal and fragmentation <br>of the thrombus • Stent recanalization • Additional TIPS following the <br>aforementioned methods • Partial splenic embolization • Variceal <br>embolization The IR treatment is usually performed under general anesthesia, <br>but in some cases, it may be performed under local anesthesia with systemic <br>sedation. The patient's heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation <br>should be monitored continuously. Smallest possible instruments should be <br>used. Planning of the IR treatment should be based on the location and <br>extent of PVO. In case of extrahepatic PVO, percutaneous transhepatic or <br>transjugular transhepatic, similar to the TIPS technique, should be used <br>(6). If the intrahepatic PV branches are occluded, transhepatic access may <br>be difficult or impossible. In these cases, trans-splenic access may be <br>preferred. For a percutaneous transhepatic or trans-splenic access, a <br>micropuncture technique is recommended. When access to PV has been <br>established, venography is performed using ionic contrast or CO(2). The <br>pressure gradient is assessed, and recanalization of the obstructed segment <br>is attempted. The occluded segment can usually be traversed using <br>hydrophilic guidewire and standard angiographic catheters. Thrombolysis with <br>or without thrombus fragmentation/aspiration may be attempted in cases of <br>acute/subacute thrombosis. Use of different tools intended for the treatment <br>of arterial or venous thrombosis may be beneficial. Stent or stent-grafts <br>are used to stabilize the recanalized segment if necessary (7-9). Additional <br>embolization of varices may be performed with an aim to increase the flow to <br>the recanalized segment. After the procedures, the transhepatic or <br>trans-splenic tract should be embolized with coils, plugs, and/or gelatine <br>sponge. Intraarterial thrombolysis with an infusion of thrombolytics in SMA <br>may be tried in cases of acute PV thrombosis. Another type of treatment is <br>partial splenic embolization, which may also be performed in order to <br>decrease the inflow of blood to the portal system and/or decrease symptoms <br>(5). The results depend on the origin of PVO. Recanalization of the occluded <br>segments has a relatively good outcome if intrahepatic PV branches are <br>patent. Otherwise, additional TIPS may be necessary (10,11). In patients <br>with malignant PV invasion, the outcome after stent placement is less <br>favorable if the splanchnic veins are involved and/or if severe hepatic <br>dysfunction is present (8). The treatment in children should be adapted to <br>the age and size of the patient (12,13). Due to the relative rarity of PVO, <br>comparison of results of different treatment methods is difficult, as is <br>planning of randomized studies. It was reported that the recanalization rate <br>was higher in patients receiving <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> compared to no treatment at <br>all (3). In reports describing endovascular treatment, the results were <br>generally promising (5). PVO is a serious condition, which may cause <br>life-threatening bleeding or bowel ischemia. Imaging can define the extent <br>and localization of PVO. The interventions provided by IR should be based on <br>the decision of a multidisciplinary team. Possibility of future liver <br>transplant should be discussed, if stents or stent-grafts are used. The IR <br>treatment usually has a good outcome, but should be planned carefully <br>according to the extent and localization of PVO, hemodynamic flow pattern, <br>causality, and vascular anatomy.<br><br>RECORD 272<br>A case report: Venous infarction of the spleen.

As the majority of <br>published studies focuses on simultaneous pancreas transplants and use <br>varied defi nitions, it is diffi cult to draw inferences about the true <br>incidence and the factors impacting early graft thrombosis (within 90 days) <br>in solitary pancreas transplants (SPTx) .Aim: The aim of the study was to <br>identify the clinically relevant incidence of early graft thrombosis in SPTx <br>and summarize the risk factors. Methods: Between 1997 and 2012, 192 SPTx <br>were performed at our center. Patients were diagnosed as either partial <br>thrombosis (nonocclusive thrombus in the main iliac artery Y graft or portal <br>vein, thrombosis of the main splenic vein,splenic artery), or complete <br>thrombosis (complete occlusion of the iliac Y graft, portal vein) or no <br>thrombosis (no evidence of thrombosis, small distal splenic vein <br>thrombus)Results:11.5% of patients demonstrated either partial or complete <br>pancreas graft thrombosis within 90 days of transplant.64% of which were <br>patients with complete graft thrombosis (portal vein 51%, iliac artery Y <br>graft 36%); 36% had partial graft thrombosis (portal vein 87%, iliac artery <br>Y graft 13%).

Date of Publication: 1 Jul <br>2014<br><br>Venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) and <br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) occur in up to 6.3 % and 15.9 % of patients <br>with cirrhosis, respectively. There is recent evidence that a procoagulable <br>prothrombotic state is related to cirrhosis despite the reduced levels of <br>many coagulation factors, and decreased platelet counts. Indeed, (i) the <br>combination of high levels of factor VIII, with low levels of protein C and <br>antithrombin induces a procoagulant state in vitro; while (ii) increased <br>levels of von Willebrand factor and decreased ADAMTS 13 activity can <br>compensate for decreased platelet counts. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is partial in a majority of <br>patients in whom it develops and may spontaneously resolve in some of them. <br>Although <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is associated with features of more severe liver disease, it is <br>uncertain whether it plays a causal role in the decompensation of cirrhosis. <br>In patients listed for liver transplantation, <span style="color: red">PVT</span> may make the procedure <br>difficult or impossible. Pretransplant <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is associated with increased <br>post-transplant mortality rates. Studies evaluating clinical outcome of <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy for splanchnic or extrasplanchnic venous thrombosis <br>are scarce. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy, given to patients with cirrhosis of <br>intermediate severity before <span style="color: red">PVT</span> occurrence, in prophylactic doses, appears <br>to decrease decompensation and mortality rate. Interestingly, this <br>improvement is out of proportion of the prophylaxis of extrahepatic portal <br>vein thrombosis. The risk of bleeding does not seem to be increased in <br>patients with cirrhosis receiving <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy, once prophylaxis <br>for bleeding related to portal hypertension has been implemented. Overall, <br>the room for <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy is probably larger than previously <br>recognized, and may be of particular benefit in patients without portal vein <br>thrombosis.

With a vast experience in Living Related Liver <br>Transplantation we looked into our data to share our experience in managing <br>these patient. Materials and Method: At our centre we follow the stepwise <br>protocol with <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, vascular intervention and finally liver <br>transplantation for cirrhotic liver. All the patient undergo work-up for <br>pro-coagulant state ( protein C, S; Leiden V, antithrombin III, <br>anticardiolipin, antiphospholipid, Homocysteine assessment) along with <br>screening for myeloproliferative disease (JAK-2 mutation )and CT liver angio <br>gram. Results : Pre-operatively out of 12 patients we transplanted 4 had <br>protein C and S deficiency. Indication of transplantation was <br>Hepato-pulmonary syndrome, blocked MHV stent and Cirrhosis. All patient <br>underwent surgery by abdominal approach with porta dissection and ligation <br>first technique. The operative time as well as the blood loss was higher as <br>compared to controls requiring meticulous control of the collaterals. Five <br>patient had <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in addition to outflow obstruction <br>requiring portal vein thrombectomy. Liver was explanted in all cases with <br>individually clamping the hepatic veins and dividing them without the need <br>for caval clamping. Associated thrombus in the inferior venacava was dealt <br>with Thrombectomy, Thrombectomy and dilatation of the venacava, Cavatomy and <br>interposition onlay graft to restore the lumen (7cm long and 1.5 cm wide <br>circumferential Gortex graft around 180 degrees ) In one case spontaneous <br>recannalisation of the Inferior venacava was observed.

Vannucchi A.M.<br>Haematologica (2014) 99 SUPPL. 1 (128). Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2014<br><br>Background: Philadelphia-negative Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPN) include <br>Polycythemia Vera (PV), Essential Thrombocythemia (ET), Myelofibrosis both <br>Primary (PMF) and secondary to PV and ET (PPV-, PET-MF) as well as <br>unclassified MPN (U-MPN). An increased risk of venous thrombosis in unusual <br>sites, ie splanchnic vessels (SVT), is particularly associated with MPN. SVT <br>can lead to complications such as portal hypertension, esophageal and <br>gastric varices, ascites and hepatic failure. A recent meta-analysis <br>reported that a MPN is the underlying cause of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in <br>31.5% and of Budd Chiari syndrome in 40.9% of cases (Smalberg, 2012); <br>however analysis of disease characteristics and outcome has been hampered by <br>heterogeneity of available patients' cohorts comprising relatively small <br>number of cases. Aims: We conducted a retrospective multicenter study <br>collecting clinical and biological data of patients (pts) with SVT <br>associated with WHO2008-diagnosed MPN, with the aim to describe patients' <br>characteristics, trends and prognostic factors that may have implications <br>for clinical practice. Methods: Data were collected from 16 international <br>hematologic centers in the framework of IWG-MRT. Results: A total of 494 <br>cases of portal, splenic or mesenteric vein thrombosis (75.2%) or Budd <br>Chiari syndrome (24.8%) associated with MPN were collected. Current analysis <br>refers to 475/494 cases, and final data will be presented at EHA meeting. <br>Frequency of MPN associated subtype was 38.1% ET (n=181), 34.9% PV (n=166), <br>16.2% MF (n=77), 10.8% U-MPN (n=51). Median follow-up 87.9 mo (range <br>0.5-430); female 61.3% (n=292; P<0.0001 vs male); median age at MPN <br>diagnosis (dg) 44.4 y (range 12-90), significantly younger than non-SVT <br>associated MPN. In 229 cases (48%) MPN and SVT dg were coincident, while in <br>104 (22%) SVT occurred before MPN dg (median 40 mo, range 5-335) and in 129 <br>(27%) during MPN follow up (median 79 mo, range 5-394). Biological featured <br>included JAK2V617F mutation present in 99% PV, 84.7% ET, 88.1% PMF and 92.9% <br>U-MPN pts, while erythropoietin-independent colonies (EEC) were present at <br>diagnosis in 80/110 evaluated cases (72.7%), 38/47 PV (84.4%), 32/45 ET <br>(71.1%), 8/11 PMF (72.7%) and 2/7 U-MPN (28.6%). A concurrent thrombophilic <br>status was found in 38.9% of cases. Therapy after SVT included <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in 77% of pts, antiaggregant therapy in 23.5% and both in <br>1.5%; 68.8% of pts received cytotoxic drugs, 11.4% were treated with trans <br>jugular portosystemic shunt. No differences in survival were noted with <br>these approaches. Beta blockers was used in 48.5% of pts and correlated with <br>improved survival (p=0.041). At last follow up 70/473 pts (14.8%) died; <br>causes of death are evolution to AL (16.4%), other cancers (14.5%), disease <br>progression without AL (12.7%), SVT (10.9%), hepatic failure and venous <br>thrombosis other than SVT (9.1% each), heart failure and arterial thrombosis <br>(7.3% each), hemorrhage (5.5%), renal failure and infection (3.6% each). <br>After 10 y follow up 8/166 PV (5%), 14/181 ET (8%), 14/77 PMF (18%) and 1/51 <br>U-MPN (1.96%) pts died (p<0.01). Survival was significantly affected by <br>occurrence of thrombosis other than SVT (p<0.0001), that occurred in 35.8% <br>of pts but not by recurrence in splanchnic vessels (p=0.068). Summary and <br>Conclusions: This large study describes characteristics, therapeutic options <br>and outcome of SVT associated with MPN, pointing to an overall good <br>prognosis compared with non-SVT associated MPN and identified thrombosis in <br>districts other than splancnic district as the leading cause of death, <br>suggesting the need to potentiate antithrombotic therapy.<br><br>RECORD 284<br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> after hepatectomy<br>Yoshiya S.

This study evaluated the incidence, risk <br>factors, and clinical outcomes of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> after hepatectomy.METHODS: The <br>preoperative and postoperative clinical characteristics of patients who <br>underwent hepatectomy were retrospectively analyzed.RESULTS: A total of 208 <br>patients were reviewed. The incidence of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> after hepatectomy was 9.1 % (n <br>= 19), including main portal vein (MPV) thrombosis (n = 7) and peripheral <br>portal vein (PPV) thrombosis (n = 12). Patients with MPV thrombosis had a <br>significantly higher incidence of right hepatectomy (p < 0.001), larger <br>resection volume (p = 0.003), and longer operation time (p = 0.021) than <br>patients without <span style="color: red">PVT</span> (n = 189). Multivariate analysis identified right <br>hepatectomy as a significant independent risk factor for MPV thrombosis <br>(odds ratio 108.9; p < 0.001). Patients with PPV thrombosis had a <br>significantly longer duration of Pringle maneuver than patients without <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>(p = 0.002). Among patients who underwent right hepatectomy, those with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>(n = 6) had a significantly lower early liver regeneration rate than those <br>without <span style="color: red">PVT</span> (n = 13; p = 0.040), and those with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> had deterioration of <br>liver function on postoperative day 7.

Ponraj C. Masand P. Himes R. Hernandez A. Pimpalwar S.<br>Pediatric Radiology (2014) 44 SUPPL. 1 (S159). Date of Publication: May 2014<br><br>Purpose or Case Report: Children with symptomatic PDV are selected for <br>endovascular occlusion based on the size of intrahepatic portal veins and <br>portal pressures after balloon test occlusion. Recently, C-arm angiography <br>systems have the capability to acquire CT-like 3D images of vascular anatomy <br>which could be applied in this scen Our purpose is: 1. To illustrate the <br>additional value of C-arm CT in imaging PDVand its intraprocedural role in <br>guiding endovascular occlusion using vascular plug. 2. To illustrate the <br>steps involved in endovascular PDVocclusion procedure and to report a <br>complication of post-procedural <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. A 4 years old girl <br>with Trisomy 12 mosaicism presented with a 3 years history of recurrent <br>episodes of altered mental status and hyperammonemia (49-136 micromol/L). <br>MRV showed a 10 mm diameter PDV. Using a right jugular venous approach, <br>C-arm CT superior mesenteric venography was performed pre and post balloon <br>occlusion. Hemodynamic pressure measurements were obtained and the PDV was <br>occluded using a 14 mm Amplatzer Vascular Plug II under C-arm CT guidance. <br>C-arm CT (syngo DynaCT®, Siemens AG, Forchheim, Germany) imaging was <br>performed using 8-s DR low dose body protocol. Fortymilliliter4 iodinated <br>contrast (320 mgI/ml) was injected through a 4Fr catheter at 4 ml/s, 500 psi <br>with 2-s X-ray delay. Initial C-arm CT venography was helpful in <br>demonstrating the complex 3D relationship between the PDV, left portal vein <br>and IVC. C-arm CT imaging further helped with confirmation of device size <br>and position in relationship to the portal vein and IVC prior to actual <br>deployment. Serum ammonia levels normalized within 2 days post occlusion. <br>Twelve hours post procedure ultrasound demonstrated an occlusive left portal <br>vein thrombus which was treated with intravenous heparin and subsequently <br>transitioned to lovenox. Three months follow-up ultrasound showed complete <br>occlusion of the PDV and resolution of the portal venous thrombus.

Romero L. Cornudella R. Gaván <br>O.<br>Thrombosis Research (2014) 133 SUPPL. 3 (S80). Date of Publication: May 2014<br><br>Background: Thrombosis in atypical locations is infrequent, although when it <br>develops it is extremely severe and associated with significant morbidity <br>and mortality. It has been associated with different pathologies such as <br>hepatic cirrhosis, neoplasia and hereditary thrombophilia. It is crucial to <br>carry out full and early anticoagulant treatment in attempting to reduce <br>complications derived from this pathology. This review examines risk factors <br>in patients under oral anticoagulant treatment for portal vein or <br>spleno-portal axis thrombosis. Methods: Clinical histories from the years <br>2000 to 2013 were revised and the data in the study of coagulation, the <br>study of plasmatic thrombophilia (PC, PS, AT, RPCA, lupus anticoagulant), <br>genetic thrombophilia with FV R506Q (Leiden) and FV H1299R (R2) mutations, <br>and prothrombin G20210A and MTHFR mutations. In other determinations the <br>V617F gen JAK2 mutation was studied. Results: A total of 25 patients were <br>studied, of which 22 were male and 4 were female, with ages ranging from 37 <br>and 78 years old. The pathology associated with portal vein and <br>spleno-portal axis thrombosis of highest incidence are haematological <br>processes (SMPC) 32% (in 8 patients), followed closely by hepatic cirrhosis <br>in 28% (7 patients), associated to surgical processes in 24% (3 hepatic <br>post-transplant, 1 splenectomy, 1transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic <br>derivation) and in relation to inflammatory processes 16% (in 4 patients). A <br>study of plasmatic and genetic thrombophilia was carried out in 76% of the <br>patients studied, with a resulting relevance of 17%, not evaluable for <br>plasmatic thrombophilia due to oral anticoagulant treatment or hepatopathy <br>in 59% and not pathological in 24%. In 2 patients (28%), the FV Leiden <br>mutation was detected. The mutation V617F gen JAK2 was positive in 4 <br>patients with Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) (16% of patients studied). <br>Conclusions: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> is more prevalent in males. The most <br>frequent haematological process associated with <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> is <br>ET, with positive JAK2. In relation to surgical processes, a hepatic <br>transplant supposes a high risk for the development of portal vein <br>thrombosis. The FV Leiden mutation in <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> was detected <br>associated to surgery (hepatic post-transplant) and another to hepatopathy. <br>It is recommended to carry out, together with a study of thrombophilia, the <br>mutation V617F gen JAK2 in all patients without associated hepatopathy to <br>rule out haematological processes.<br><br>RECORD 289<br>Hypercoagulability in cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) <br>and <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>)<br>Zanetto A.

Aim: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the <br>thrombophilic role of HCC in cirrhotics with and without HCC and to <br>correlate the presence of HCC and the coagulation profile with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>incidence. Materials and Methods: Cirrhotic patients with and without HCC <br>were prospectively enrolled in the study. Age- and sex-matched healthy <br>individuals constituted the control group for ROTEM parameters All patients <br>underwent: thromboelastometry (ROTEM), platelet count, determination of <br>prothrombin time and of levels of pro and <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> factors. During <br>follow-up, <span style="color: red">PVT</span> onset in both patients with and without HCC was recorded. <br>Results: 76 cirrhotics, 41 with HCC and 35 without HCC, were included. <br>Forty-eight healthy volunteers were included as the control group. Volume of <br>active HCC was >5 cm(3) in 18 patients. Levels of pro- and anti-coagulation <br>factors were similar between patients with and without HCC, but fibrinogen <br>was increased in HCC patients with active volume >5cm(3) HCC compared to <br>those with <5cm(3) HCC bulk (348.72 ±124.06mg/dL vs 237.64±99.18mg/dL) and <br>to cirrhotics without HCC (260.57±126.07 mg/dL; p=0.006). Platelet count was <br>significantly increased in HCC patients compared to non-HCC patients <br>(125.41±67.88/ μL vs 86.89±54.07/μL; p=0.046), and this was especially true <br>in Child Class A subjects (152.6 ± 66.14/μL vs 92 ±46.73/μL; p=0.038). <br>Patients with HCC showed significantly lower clotting time and maximum clot <br>formation at ROTEM compared to healthy controls. The hypercoagulable state <br>was present even when HCC patients were compared to cirrhotics without HCC, <br>and was more evident when performing a subgroup analysis of Child Class A <br>patients, with statistically significant differences in MCF EXTEM, MCF NATEM <br>e CFT NATEM. The incidence of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was 24.4% (10/41) and 11.4% (4/35) in HCC <br>and non-HCC patients, respectively (OR: 2.5; 95%, CI 0.70-8.83). In the HCC <br>group, 5/10 portal vein thromboses occurred in patients in Child Class A. In <br>contrast with HCC patients who did not develop <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, at fibrinogen test of <br>ROTEM, MCF and AUC were statistically higher in HCC patients who later <br>developed <span style="color: red">PVT</span> (23.71 ±12.82 mm vs 16.30 ±7.08mm p=0.047 and 2,359±1,272.62 <br>vs 1,535±640.20 p=0.022; respectively). Conclusions: Cirrhotics with HCC <br>demonstrate a prothrombotic hemostatic balance resulting in an increased <br>risk of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> development. The unstable hemostatic balance in cirrhotic <br>patients can easily tip towards hypercoagulability due to the contribution <br>of increased fibrinogen synthesis and an increased platelet count. ROTEM <br>seems to be a sensitive method to identify hypercoagulability, that would <br>otherwise be undetected by routine laboratory testing. Further <br>investigations are needed to determine whether patients with HCC should <br>receive prophylactic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> for <span style="color: red">PVT</span> prevention.<br><br>RECORD 290<br>Circulating microparticles in cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular <br>carcinoma (HCC) and <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span><br>Campello E. Zanetto A. Radu C.M. Gavasso S. Spiezia L. Rodriguez K. Senzolo <br>M. Simioni P.<br>Thrombosis Research (2014) 133 SUPPL. 2 (S195). Date of Publication: May <br>2014<br><br>Introduction: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a hypervascular tumor with <br>high levels of apoptosis and tumor necrosis. Microparticles (MP) are small <br>membrane vesicles released from the cell plasma membrane, particularly in <br>cell stress, apoptosis and altered cellular viability. Aim: We investigated <br>(1) the levels of circulating MP of different cellular origins in patients <br>with cirrhosis with and without HCC and compared them with healthy people, <br>and (2) the correlation between MP levels and <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) <br>incidence in HCC patients. Materials and Methods: Seventy-six cirrhotic <br>patients [Child: A 29, B 29, C 18]: 41 with HCC (M/F 22/19; mean age 64±12 <br>years) and 35 without HCC (M/F 18/17; mean age 56±14) were prospectively <br>enrolled. Age- and sex-matched healthy individuals constituted the control <br>group. MP were identified by size and Annexin V-FITC labelling, using <br>flow-cytometry. Endothelial-derived activated MP (E-Selectin+) were <br>identified using anti-CD62E-PE; Tissue factor-bearing (TF+) with <br>anti-CD142-PE; and Thrombomodulin-bearing MP (TM+) with anti-CD141-FITC <br>antibodies. MP procoagulant activity was measured using the STA Procoag PPL <br>assay. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> onset in both patients with and without HCC was recorded. <br>Results: Patients with HCC showed significantly higher levels of E-Selectin+ <br>(median 23380 [Interquartile range 1,9487-4,1172] MP/μL), TF+ (102 [94-168] <br>MP/μL) and Annexin V-MP (5146 [1,619-6,264] MP/μL) compared to healthy <br>controls (4,395 [3,329-7,253 MP/μL; 68 [17-93] MP/μL; 1,900 [1,154-2,114] <br>MP/μL; all p<0.001). Moreover we showed a significant increase in <br>E-Selectin+ and in TF+ in HCC patients compared to cirrhotics without HCC <br>(p<0.001 and 0.05, respectively). The PPL clotting time was significantly <br>shorter (p<0.05) in HCC patients (61 [48- 71] sec) compared to cirrhotics <br>(72 [67-80] sec) and controls (81 [68- 101] sec). As for TM+, cirrhotics had <br>lower levels (42 [27-85] MP/μL) than HCC patients (60 [52-76] MP/μL) and <br>controls (86 [70-102] MP/μL), the differences were not significant. MP <br>circulating levels did not significantly differ between Child A versus B and <br>C in HCC patients. The incidence of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was 24.4% (10/41) and 11.4% (4/35) <br>in HCC and non-HCC patients, respectively (OR: 2,5; 95%, CI 0.70-8.83). The <br>levels of E-Selectin+ (24,561 [20,006-31,765] MP/μL) and TF+ (124 [101-188] <br>MP/μL) were statistically higher in HCC patients who later developed <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>(p=0.002 and p=0.04; respectively) compared to HCC patients who did not <br>develop <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Conclusions: Cirrhosis is associated with an increase in <br>endothelial and TF+ MP and a decrease of TM+MP compared to healthy controls. <br>Moreover, cirrhotics with HCC showed higher MP circulating plasma levels <br>than cirrhotic patients without HCC. MP may have a role in the <br>hypercoagulability that characterizes the unstable haemostatic balance in <br>cirrhotic patients and could be considered a sensitive method to identify <br>hypercoagulability in HCC patients that should receive prophylactic <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> for <span style="color: red">PVT</span> prevention.<br><br>RECORD 291<br>Gastrointestinal ischemia in patients with acute and chronic portal vein <br>thrombosis: A prospective study<br>Harki J. Plompen E.P. Van Noord D. Hoekstra J. Kuipers E.J. Janssen H. Tjwa <br>E.T.<br>Gastroenterology (2014) 146:5 SUPPL. 1 (S-478). Date of Publication: May <br>2014<br><br>Introduction: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) patients often experience <br>abdominal pain, in part of the cases caused by gastrointestinal ischemia <br>(GI). Little is known about the frequency of GI as result of venous <br>congestion. GI is characterized by specific complaints and mucosal <br>desaturation. The aim of this study therefore was to evaluate the prevalence <br>of GI in acute and chronic <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Methodology: A prospective cohort study <br>between 2009 and 2013. Patients with non-cirrhotic, non-malignant <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>received the standard work-up for <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and were assessed for clinical <br>symptoms of GI along with radiological evaluation and state-ofthe- art <br>mucosal intraluminal saturation measurements by means of visible light <br>spectroscopy (VLS). Differences between groups were assessed using <br>descriptive and non-parametric statistics. Results: We included 17 <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>patients (median 48 (IQR31-54) years; 59% female). Acute <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was present in <br>5 patients and chronic <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in 12 patients. VLS measurements below the <br>established cut-off of 58% saturation (i.e. indicating ischemia) for <br>duodenal mucosa were found in 12/16 patients (75%). They were more frequent <br>in patients with chronic <span style="color: red">PVT</span> compared to acute <span style="color: red">PVT</span> (82% vs. 60%, p=0.37 and <br>median saturation 53% (IQR49-58) vs. 58% (IQR55-63), respectively, p=0.07, <br>see Figure 1). Exercise-induced pain and weight loss, both typical for GI, <br>were present in 47% and 41% of the patients and were more present in <br>patients with chronic compared to acute <span style="color: red">PVT</span> (58% vs. 20%, p=0.16 and 50% vs. <br>20% , p=0.27 respectively). There was a marked difference in <br>exercise-induced pain, but not weight loss, between patients with normal and <br>decreased VLS measurements (0% vs. 67%, p= 0.025). Postprandial pain was <br>present in 9 patients (53%) and patients with decreased VLS measurements <br>tend to experience postprandial pain more often than patients with normal <br>VLS measurements (67% vs. 25%, p=0.16). No clear relationship was observed <br>between mucosal ischemia and degree of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> occlusion, use of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>or extrahepatic venous involvement. None of the patients had <br>gastrointestinal arterial involvement. Conclusions: Typical symptoms of <br>gastrointestinal ischemia are frequently observed in patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and <br>more prevalent in patients with chronic <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Mucosal ischemia is present in <br>the majority of patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and exercise-induced pain seems to be the <br>most specific indicator of mucosal ischemia. In patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, VLS <br>measurements should be considered to assess ischemia and tailor patient <br>management.

Date of Publication: May 2014<br><br>Background: Left ventricular (LV) thrombosis is a potentially <br>lifethreatening condition, with a high risk of embolic complications. Many <br>conditions increase the risk of LV thrombi (dilated cardiomyopathy (severe <br>LV dysfunction, myocarditis, myocardial infarction or ventricular aneurysm). <br>Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) usually gives the diagnosis, being the <br>use of ultrasound contrast media useful to enhance its diagnostic accuracy. <br>The information available about the treatment of intraventricular thrombosis <br>is scarce. Despite the lack of evidence, the empiric use of vitamin K <br>antagonists for up to 6 months is recommended in patients with myocardial <br>infarction and mural thrombi. In the heart failure scenario, oral <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> is only indicated in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). <br>The efficacy and safety of new oral anticoagulants in this context is <br>unknown. It has been reported that rivaroxaban, oral direct factor Xa <br>inhibitor currently indicated for the prevention of stroke and systemic <br>embolism in patients with non-valvular AF, can be successfully used to treat <br>thrombosis in other locations, such as left atrial appendage thrombus and <br>acute <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. Methods: We present the case of a 78 year-old <br>patient admitted in our hospital for congestive heart failure. The ECG <br>showed AF (first known episode) and complete left bundle branch block. His <br>creatinine clearance was 40 ml/min by MDRD. Oral <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was <br>initiated with Rivaroxaban 15 mg/day. The TTE showed dilated LV with severe <br>sistolic dysfunction, and 2 images of thrombi inside the LV cavity, one in <br>the basal inferior segment and other in the apex (figure 1 A y B). <br>Carvedilol 6.25mg b.i.d., enalapril 10mg b.i.d. and intravenous furosemide <br>were added to the treatment. He refused to undergo an invasive <br>coronariography. Patient was discharged following clinical stabilization. <br>After 4 weeks of treatment, the new TTE showed complete resolution of both <br>thrombi (figure 1 C y D) and patient was asymptomatic. Results: Results of <br>the Transtoracic Echocardiogram will be shown in the figure. Conclusions: To <br>our knowledge, this is the first case reported about the resolution of LV <br>thrombosis with Rivaroxaban. No randomized clinical trials have been <br>specifically performed, but are needed, on the use of new oral <br>anticoagulants in the clinical scenarios of dilated cardiomyopathy and <br>thrombosis in the LV.<br><br>RECORD 293<br>Percutaneous microwave ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma: Clinical <br>results with 118 tumors treated over 3 years<br>Ziemlewicz T.

Date <br>of Publication: May 2014<br><br>Objectives: Microwave (MW) ablation is a promising technology that offers <br>several advantages over radiofrequency (RF) ablation. However, clinical <br>evaluation of microwave ablation is limited currently. The purpose of this <br>study was to retrospectively review the results in the first 79 patients <br>with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with a high-power, gas-cooled MW <br>device at a single center. Methods: Between December 2010 and November 2013 <br>we treated 118 hepatocellular carcinomas in 85 sessions in 79 BCLC stage A <br>patients via a percutaneous approach utilizing US and/or CT guidance. There <br>were 64 male and 15 female patients with mean age of 60.5 years (range <br>44-82). All procedures were performed with a highpowered, gas-cooled <br>microwave system (Certus 140, Neuwave Medical, Madison, WI). Complications <br>were recorded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. Follow- up with <br>contrast-enhanced CT or MR was planned at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 <br>months post-procedure. Results: Tumors ranged in size from 0.5 to 4.2 cm <br>(mean 2.1 cm) and median followup was 12 months (range 1-35). All treatments <br>were completed in a single session and considered technically successful <br>with no evidence of residual tumor at immediate post-procedure CECT. Mean <br>power was 73 Watts (range 30-140 Watts) and mean ablation time was 5.1 <br>minutes (range 1-11.5 minutes). Primary treatment effectiveness by imaging <br>was 93.2% (110/118), 93.1% (95/102) for tumors < 3 cm, 100% (14/14) for <br>tumors 3-4 cm, and 50% (1/2) for tumors > 4 cm. Of the 8 tumor progressions, <br>2 were treated with repeat ablation, 2 were noted at explant pathology, and <br>4 were treated with intra-arterial therapy as they were abutting an adjacent <br>critical structure, precluding more aggressive ablation, or multifocal HCC <br>had developed in the interval. Distant intrahepatic progression occurred in <br>20.2% of patients during the follow-up period with 5 patients undergoing <br>repeat ablation and the other 11 developing multifocal disease treated with <br>intra-arterial or systemic therapy. A single Grade II complication occurred <br>(1.2%), a main portal vein thrombus following ablation of a caudate lobe <br>lesion, which was noted at 1-month follow-up and resolved with low dose <br>anti-coagulation (target INR 1.5-2.0). There were no Grade III or higher <br>complications. There was no procedure related mortality. Overall survival is <br>78.8% with most deaths related to end stage liver disease (n=8) or <br>multifocal HCC (n=5). Conclusions: Treating hepatocellular carcinoma using <br>percutaneous microwave ablation is safe, and in our experience is as <br>effective with small (<3 cm) tumors, but more effective with larger tumors <br>(excellent efficacy maintained up to 4 cm) as compared to other more <br>established ablation modalities.<br><br>RECORD 294<br>Gastrointestinal ischemia in patients with acute and chronic portal vein <br>thrombosis<br>Harki J.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate <br>the thrombophilic role of HCC as risk factor for development of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. <br>Methods: Cirrhotic patients with and without HCC were prospectively enrolled <br>in the study and underwent: thromboelastometry (ROTEM), platelet count, <br>determination of prothrombin time and of levels of pro and <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>factors. During follow-up, <span style="color: red">PVT</span> onset in both patients with and without HCC <br>was recorded. Results: 76 cirrhotics, 41 with HCC, were included. Volume of <br>active HCC was >5cm(3) in 18 patients. Levels of pro and <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>factors were similar between patients with and without HCC, but fibrinogen <br>was increased in HCC patients with active volume >5cm(3) HCC compared to <br>those with ≤5cm(3) HCC bulk (348.72±124.06 mg/dL vs 237.64±99.18 mg/dL) and <br>to cirrhotics without HCC (260.57±126.07 mg/dL) (p = 0.006). Platelet count <br>was significantly increased in HCC compared to non-HCC patients, and this <br>was especially true in Child A group.

Methods: Among all the cirrhotic <br>patients who underwent OLT between 2005 and 2011 in Liver Transplant Turin <br>Centre, we retrospectively included all the patients with US and CT <br>diagnosis of pre-OLT non-neoplastic <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Extension of thrombosis (according <br>to Yerdel classification), pre-OLT clinical and US course, use of <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy (AT), surgical technique for portal vein <br>anastomosis, complications and US follow-up after OLT were collected for <br>each patient. Results: 70/997 (7%) patients were included. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was: <br>intrahepatic in 22.9%, grade 1 in 32.9%, grade 2 in 24.3%, grade 3 in 7.1% <br>and grade 4 in 12.8%. Due to thrombosis, 72% of patients started AT <br>(complications rate: 17%, all minor bleedings) and 40% underwent TIPS, <br>without complications. Pre-OLT complete resolution or regression of <br>thrombosis occurred in 74% of patients under AT vs 40% of patients not <br>treated (p = 0.04). During OLT 97% of patients underwent porto-portal <br>anastomosis, 29% of them needing thrombectomy. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> extension (both at <br>diagnosis and at OLT) and AT didn't statistically impact in terms of <br>survival and complications during and after OLT. Conclusions: <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is a <br>frequent issue in cirrhotic patients waiting for OLT. In our experience AT <br>can be safely managed allowing a pre-OLT understaging of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and the need <br>for special surgical techniques at OLT is very uncommon.<br><br>RECORD 297<br>Impact of anticoagulant therapy on upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGI) in <br>patients with <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span>. results from a retrospective multicentric <br>case-control study<br>Cerini F.

Garcia-Pagan J.C.<br>Journal of Hepatology (2014) 60:1 SUPPL. 1 (S8). Date of Publication: April <br>2014<br><br>Background and Aims: Recent studies have shown that LC is actually an <br>acquired hypercoagulable state with increased thrombotic risk and <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy (AT) is most frequently used in LC pts. Variceal <br>bleeding is a severe complication of LC. It is unknown if AT may impact the <br>outcome of UGIB in these pts. Methods: 52 pts on AT with UGIB were enrolled <br>in the study. <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) and other reasons were the <br>indication for AT in 14 and 38 pts respectively. 104 pts with LC and UGIB <br>not under AT were matched, for severity of LC, age, sex, source of UGIB and <br>SOFA score, as controls. Results: There were no differences between groups <br>except for INR/MELD. UGIB was attributed to portal hypertension (PH) in 63% <br>of pts (gastroesophageal varices in 56%) and peptic/vascular lesions in 37%. <br>17% of Pts experienced 5-days-failure being independent predictors age and <br>presence of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, but not AT. There were no differences between pts <br>with/without AT in needs for rescue therapies, ICU admission, transfusions, <br>hospital stay and 6wmortality. 11% of pts had 6w-mortality. These patients <br>had worse Child, MELD, MELD-XI, SOFA and use of AT for other reason than <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>(21% vs 7% in <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and 8% in non-AT; p = 0.03) than survivors. Independent <br>predictors of 6-weeks-mortality were SOFA score and use of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> for other <br>reason than <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Conclusions: Our study suggests that factors that impact <br>the outcome of UGIB in pts under AT, are the degree of liver failure and <br>comorbidity, but not AT itself.<br><br>RECORD 298<br>Successful treatment of diffuse <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> after splenectomy <br>following living donor liver transplantation patient<br>Kang S.H. Hwang S. Kim K.-H. Ahn C.-S. Moon D.-B. Ha T.-Y. Lee S.-G.<br>HPB (2014) 16 SUPPL. 2 (552). Date of Publication: March 2014<br><br>Introduction: Splenectomy is performed after living donor liver <br>transplantation (LDLT) for various resons, including pancytopenia, ascites, <br>left sided portal hypertension. Complications of splenectomy include <br>bleeding, pancreatic injury, infection, <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. Portal vein <br>thrombosis (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is rare but dreaded complication after splenectomy in LDLT <br>recipients that can compromise patient and graft survival. Several treatment <br>modality of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> after splenectomy are reported, including <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, <br>thrombolysis and surgical thrombectomy. Method: We recently experienced a <br>case of acute and diffuse <span style="color: red">PVT</span> after splenectomy in LDLT recipient who was <br>successfully treated with thrombectomy and systemic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy. <br>The patient was a 56- year-old female with hepatitis B virus-associated <br><span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span>. She underwent LDLT using modified right lobe graft on June <br>2, 2006. Recently she developed thrombocytopenia on routine laboratory exam. <br>A CT scan showed splenomegaly. We performed splenectomy to resolve <br>thrombocytopenia. On postoperative fifth day, she complained pain on her <br>shoulder. A CT scan was performed and showed diffuse splenic, main portal <br>and intra-hepatic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> with ischemic change in anterior <br>section. Results: The patient was taken immediately to the operating room. <br>We opened splenic stump and placed a 12-Fr Fogarty catheter. With the <br>assistance of vascular surgeon, thrombectomy of the main portal vein was <br>attempted via catheter under intra-operative ultrasound guiding. After <br>thrombectomy, intra-operative portogram revealed recanalization of the <br>splenic vein and main portal vein but still remained intra-hepatic portal <br>vein thrombosis. An interventional radiologist put the catheter into <br>intra-hepatic portal vein via inferior mesenteric vein. After several times <br>of aspiration through the catheter, portogram showed complete recanalization <br>of intra-hepatic portal vein. We put the stent into spleno-mesenteric <br>junction to prevent recurrent <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Systemic heparinization war started <br>immediately after operation and was converted warfarin. A postoperative <br>Doppler ultrasound and CT scan showed patent main and intra-hepatic portal <br>vein. Conclusions: This case showed that <span style="color: red">PVT</span> after splenectomy can be <br>treated with surgical thrombectomy, intra-operative interventional procedure <br>and systemic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy.<br><br>RECORD 299<br>Prospective evaluation of the correlation between hemostatic status and <br>incidence of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in patients with <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> and <br>hepatocellular carcinoma<br>Zanetto A.

Date of Publication: <br>March 2014<br><br>Background and aim: Studies which explores the hypercoagulable induced by <br>HCC in cirrhosis are lacking. The aim of the present study was to evaluate <br>the thrombophilic role of HCC as risk factor for development of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. <br>Material and methods: Cirrhotic patients with and without HCC were <br>prospectively enrolled in the study and underwent: thromboelastometry <br>(ROTEM), platelet count, determination of prothrombin time and of levels of <br>pro and <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> factors. During follow-up, <span style="color: red">PVT</span> onset in both <br>patients with and without HCC was recorded. Results: 76 cirrhotics, 41 with <br>HCC and 35 without HCC, were included. Forty-eight healthy volunteers were <br>included as the control group. Volume of active HCC was >5 cm(3) in 18 <br>patients. Levels of pro and <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> factors were similar between <br>patients with and without HCC, but fibrinogen was increased in HCC patients <br>with active volume >5 cm(3) HCC compared to those with ≤5 cm(3) HCC bulk <br>(348.72 mg/dL±124.06 mg/dL vs 237.64 mg/dL ±99.18 mg/dL) and to cirrhotics <br>without HCC (260.57 mg/dL±126.07 mg/dL) (p=0.006). Platelet count was <br>significantly increased in HCC patients compared to non-HCC patients, <br>especially in Child Class A subjects. Patients with HCC showed significantly <br>lower clotting time and maximum clot formation at ROTEM compared to healthy <br>controls. The hypercoagulable state was present even when HCC patients were <br>compared to cirrhotics without HCC, and was more evident when performing a <br>subgroup analysis of Child Class A patients, with statistically significant <br>differences in MCF EXTEM/NATEM e CFT NATEM. One-year-incidence of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was <br>19.5% (8/41) and 5.7% (2/35) in HCC and non-HCC patients, respectively <br>(p=0.04). In the HCC group, 4/8 <span style="color: red">PVT</span> occurred in patients in Child Class A. <br>Fibrinogen test of ROTEM, MCF and AUC were statistically elavated in HCC <br>patients who later developed <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Conclusions: Cirrhotics with HCC <br>demonstrate a prothrombotic hemostatic balance resulting in an increased <br>risk of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> development. ROTEM seems to be a sensitive method to identify <br>hypercoagulability.

Aim: To <br>evaluate the management of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> before, during and after OLT in our centre. <br>Materials and methods: Among all the cirrhotic patients who underwent OLT <br>between 2005 and 2011 in Turin Liver Transplantation Centre, we <br>retrospectively included all the patients with US and CT diagnosis of <br>pre-OLT non-neoplastic <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Extension of thrombosis (according to Yerdel <br>classification), presence of genetic prothrombotic risk factors, pre-OLT <br>clinical and US course, use of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy (AT), surgical <br>technique for portal vein anastomosis, complications and US follow-up after <br>OLT were collected for each patient. Results: 70/997 (7%) patients were <br>included. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was: intrahepatic in 22.9% of them, grade 1 in 32.9%, grade 2 <br>in 24.3%, grade 3 in 7.1% and grade 4 in 12.8%. We found very small <br>prevalence of genetic prothrombotic risk factors, and their presence did not <br>correlate with extension of thrombosis and US course. Due to thrombosis, 72% <br>of patients started AT (complications rate: 17%, all minor bleedings) and <br>40% underwent TIPS, without complications. Pre-OLT complete resolution or <br>regression of thrombosis occurred in 74% of patients under AT vs 40% of <br>patients not treated (p = 0.04).

Eldeen F.Z. Kamel Y. Kabbani M. Alsebayel M. Broering D.<br>Experimental and Clinical Transplantation (2014) 12:1 (52-54). Date of <br>Publication: February 2014<br><br>Objectives: If they do not respond to other treatments, patients with <br>Budd-Chiari syndrome are potential candidates for a liver transplant. Timing <br>for transplant is controversial; however, before other systems deteriorate, <br>early intervention in relatively stable patient may improve the outcome and <br>survival of these patients. Materials and Methods: Six patients (2 women and <br>4 men) had Budd-Chiari syndrome (1.2%) among 475 patients who had undergone <br>a liver transplant at our center between 2001 and 2012. Imaging modalities <br>including duplex ultrasound, abdominal computed tomography angiography, and <br>hematologic evaluation were part of our routine diagnostic work-up. Although <br>we perform mostly living-donor liver transplants, these patients received a <br>liver transplant from a deceased donor, because there was not enough <br>evidence to justify a living-donor liver transplant. We thought that not <br>replacing the caval vein might negatively influence the outcome. <br>Postoperatively, these recipients were started on a heparin infusion and <br>triple therapy immunosuppression; only then was warfarin introduced as <br>long-term anticoagulant. Results: Two patients died, 1 from uncontrollable <br>bleeding and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, and the other died in <br>the intensive care unit after 5 months because of multiorgan failure and <br>sepsis. One patient had <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> 9 months after the liver <br>transplant; the other patient needed a liver retransplant after 5 years <br>owing to liver failure, secondary to chronic rejection. Graft survival rate <br>was 75%, and patient survival rate was 66.6%. Conclusions: This is the first <br>article from Saudi Arabia to describe the outcome of a liver transplant in <br>this subgroup of patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome. Treatment of <br>Budd-Chiari syndrome follows a therapeutic algorithm that should start with <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> and may end up with liver transplant; however, it should be <br>considered early if other treatments fail. © Başkent University 2014 Printed <br>in Turkey.

Methods A <br>systematic review was performed to compare studies with an <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>policy (AC+) to no <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> policy (AC-) after venous resection. <br>Results There were eight AC+ studies (n = 266) and five AC- studies (n = <br>95). The AC+ studies included aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin or warfarin. <br>Only 50% of patients in the AC+ group received <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>.

Many patients referred for intestinal transplantation have a <br>history of thrombosis. We undertook an analysis of transplanted patients to <br>describe the history and frequency of thrombosis, clinical course, and <br>management strategies used. Results. Twenty-five patients underwent <br>transplantation of intestine containing blocks between 2007 and 2012; 20 of <br>25 are still alive. Five of 25 patients were transplanted with history of <br>portomesenteric thrombosis, 6 of 25 had experienced loss of venous access <br>due to thrombosis, and 6 of 25 had history of mesenteric ischemia. <br>Pretransplantation, 16 of 25 patients were anticoagulated. Thrombophilia <br>screens identified 3 of 16 patients who were JAK2 positive, 1 of 25 who had <br>antithrombin deficiency, and 1 of 25 who had a factor V Leiden heterozygote. <br>Post-transplantation, of all 16 patients who were anticoagulated <br>pretransplantation and continued postoperatively, 1 of 16 infarcted their <br>small bowel graft and 4 of 16 developed a further venous thrombosis despite <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. Of the 9 without a previous history of thrombosis, 1 had a <br>pulmonary embolus more than a decade after transplantation and another had <br>an upper limb deep vein thrombosis associated with a line. Both were then <br>anticoagulated. Seven of 25 are not anticoagulated, although they are <br>administered antiplatelet prophylaxis. Postoperative bleeding complications <br>of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> occurred in 3 patients. After a subarachnoid hemorrhage <br>in 1 of those 3 patients, <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was stopped. The other 2 patients <br>bled during ileal biopsy, and both remain on low molecular weight heparin <br>treatment. Conclusion. Those with identifiable thrombophilic tendency and a <br>history of venous or arterial thrombosis are considered to be at high risk <br>for recurrent thrombosis. Those without such a history could be considered <br>low risk. Our practice is to anticoagulate all high-risk individuals before <br>and after transplantation and offer antiplatelet prophylaxis to low-risk <br>patients as the risk of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> probably outweighs the risk of <br>thrombosis for them.

Date of Publication: 21 Jan 2014<br><br>Background: Acute thrombosis of the portal vein (PV) and/or the mesenteric <br>vein (MV) is a rare but potentially life-threatening disease. A multitude of <br>risk factors for acute <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>)/mesenteric vein <br>thrombosis (MVT) have been identified, including <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span>, <br>malignancy, coagulation disorders, intra-abdominal infection/inflammation, <br>and postoperative condition. Methods: This article analyses the treatment <br>options for acute <span style="color: red">PVT</span>/MVT. Results: Initially, the clinical management <br>should identify patients with an intra-abdominal focus requiring immediate <br>surgical intervention (e.g. bowel ischaemia). Subsequently, emphasis is <br>placed on the recanalization of the PV/MV or at least the prevention of <br>thrombus extension to avoid long-term complications of portal hypertension. <br>Several therapeutic options are currently available, including <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy, local/systemic thrombolysis, interventional or <br>surgical thrombectomy, and a combination of these procedures. Due to the <br>lack of prospective randomized studies, a comparison between these <br>therapeutic approaches regarding the efficacy of PV/MV recanalization is <br>difficult, if not impossible. Conclusion: In patients with acute <span style="color: red">PVT</span>/MVT, an <br>individualized treatment based on the clinical presentation, the underlying <br>disease, the extent of the thrombosis, and the patients' comorbidities is <br>mandatory.

Date of <br>Publication: 1 Nov 2014<br><br>Background & Aims: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to <br>evaluate the associations of the coagulation factor V (encoded by F5) Leiden <br>(FVL) or prothrombin (encoded by F2) G20210A mutation with Budd-Chiari <br>syndrome or <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>). Methods: Relevant articles were <br>identified in searches of the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and <br>ScienceDirect databases. The prevalence of the FVL and prothrombin G20210A <br>mutations were compared between patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome or <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>without cirrhosis and healthy individuals (controls) and between patients <br>with cirrhosis, with and without <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence <br>intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results: We initially identified 869 <br>articles, and included 27 in our final analysis. Compared with controls, <br>patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome had a significantly higher prevalence of <br>the FVL mutation (OR, 6.21; 95% CI, 3.93-9.79) and a similar prevalence of <br>the prothrombin G20210A mutation (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 0.69-5.23); patients <br>with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> without cirrhosis had a significantly higher prevalence of the FVL <br>mutation (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.09-3.13) or the prothrombin G20210A mutation <br>(OR, 5.01; 95% CI, 3.03-8.30). Compared with patients with cirrhosis without <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span>, patients with cirrhosis and <span style="color: red">PVT</span> had a significantly higher prevalence <br>of the FVL mutation (OR, 2.55; 95% CI, 1.29-5.07).

The purpose of this <br>study was to present a series of patients who developed postoperative portal <br>vein thrombosis after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Methods: This is a <br>retrospective analysis of patients who underwent sleeve gastrectomy between <br>June 2005 and June 2011 who developed <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. Demographic <br>data, personal risk factors, family history of thrombosis, and postoperative <br>results of thrombophilia study were analyzed in this study. Results: A total <br>of 1,713 laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomies were performed. Seventeen <br>patients (1%) developed <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> after surgery. Of the 17 <br>patients, 16 were women, 8 had a history of smoking, 7 used oral <br>contraceptives, and 2 had a family history of deep vein thrombosis of the <br>lower limbs. All patients were discharged on the third day of surgery with <br>no immediate complications. Symptoms presented at a median of 15 (range, <br>8-43) days after surgery with abdominal pain in most cases. One case <br>required emergency laparotomy and splenectomy because of an active bleeding <br>hematoma with massive portomesenteric vein thrombosis. In 11 cases, a <br>thrombosis of the main portal vein was identified, in 15 the right portal <br>branch was compromised, and in 10 the left portal branch. Eleven patients <br>presented thrombosis of the superior mesenteric vein, and ten patients <br>presented a concomitant thrombosis of the splenic vein. A massive PMVT was <br>presented in six cases. Seven patients had a positive thrombophilia study. <br>Conclusions: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> and/or mesenteric thrombosis are <br>relatively uncommon complications in patients undergoing bariatric surgery. <br>In this series, the portomesenteric vein thrombosis was the most common <br>complication after LSG in a high-volume center. © 2014 Springer <br>Science+Business Media.<br><br>RECORD 318<br>Long-term outcome of percutaneous transhepatic balloon angioplasty for <br>portal vein stenosis after pediatric living donor liver transplantation: A <br>single institute's experience<br>Yabuta M.

Materials and <br>Methods Between October 1997 and December 2013, of 527 pediatric patients <br>(age < 18 y) who underwent LDLT in a single institution, 43 patients (19 <br>boys, 24 girls; mean age, 4.1 y ± 4.1) were confirmed to have PVS at direct <br>portography with or without manometry and underwent percutaneous <br>interventions, including balloon angioplasty with or without stent <br>placement. Technical success, clinical success, laboratory findings, <br>manometry findings, patency rates, and major complications were evaluated. <br>Follow-up periods after initial balloon angioplasty ranged from 5-169 months <br>(mean, 119 mo). Results Technical success was achieved in 65 of 66 sessions <br>(98.5%) and in 42 of 43 patients (97.7%), and clinical success was achieved <br>in 37 of 43 patients (86.0%). Platelet counts improved significantly. Of 32 <br>patients undergoing manometry, 19 showed significant improvement of pressure <br>gradient across the stenosis after percutaneous transhepatic balloon <br>angioplasty. At 1, 3, 5, and 10 years after balloon angioplasty, the rates <br>of primary patency were 83%, 78%, 76%, and 70%, and the rates of <br>primary-assisted patency were 100%, 100%, 100%, and 96%.

Date of Publication: 1 Sep 2014<br><br>Objective: To analyze the risk factors for portal venous system thrombosis <br>(PVST) formation and the effect of thrombolytic therapy in patients with <br>posthepatitic cirrhosis complicating portal hypertension after splenectomy <br>and pericardial devascularization. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed our <br>records of 71 patients with posthepatitic cirrhosis complicating portal <br>hypertension who underwent splenectomy and pericardial devascularization at <br>our hospital between January 2005 and December 2011. The 71 patients were <br>divided into three groups: Group A (23 who received <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy <br>in the early period of postoperation), Group B (29 who received <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy when their postoperative platelet count was <br>>300×10(9)/L), and Group C (19 who did not receive postoperative <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy). The incidence of PVST, the anatomic distribution <br>of thrombosis, and the effect of thrombolytic therapy were compared among <br>the three groups and the relationship between PVST and various factors <br>before and during operation was determined. Results: Multivariate analysis <br>showed that PVST after splenectomy and pericardial devascularization was <br>related to the diameter of main portal vein and low preoperative platelet <br>counts. The total incidence of PVST was 40.8 % (29/71). The incidence of <br>portal venous system thrombosis in Groups A, B and C was 26.1% (6/23), 44.8% <br>(13/29), and 52.6% (10/19), respectively, without obvious differences among <br>these groups. Thrombosis of the portal vein and its branches was found <br>postoperatively. Splenic vein thrombosis accounted for 72.4% of all PVST. <br>The rate of complete resolution of portal and superior mesenteric venous <br>thrombosis was 76.2% (16/21), while that was only 23.8% (5/21) for splenic <br>vein thrombosis (χ(2)=11.524, P=0.001), which was significantly different <br>from the former (χ(2)=11.524,P=0.001). Conclusion: The diameter of main <br>portal vein and low preoperative platelet counts were independent risk <br>factors for PVST in patient with posthepatitic cirrhosis complicating portal <br>hypertension after splenectomy and pericardial devascularization. Preventive <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy does not affect PVST formation.

Date <br>of Publication: 1 Dec 2014<br><br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is being increasingly recognized in patients <br>with advanced cirrhosis and in those undergoing liver transplantation. <br>Reduced flow in the portal vein is probably responsible for clotting in the <br>spleno-porto-mesenteric venous system. There is also increasing evidence <br>that hypercoagulability occurs in advanced liver disease and contributes to <br>the risk of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Ultrasound based studies have reported a prevalence of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>in 10-25% of cirrhotic patients without hepatocellular carcinoma. Partial <br>thrombosis of the portal vein is more common and may not have <br>pathophysiological consequences. However, there is high risk of progression <br>of partial <span style="color: red">PVT</span> to complete <span style="color: red">PVT</span> that may cause exacerbation of portal <br>hypertension and progression of liver insufficiency. It is thus, essential <br>to accurately diagnose and stage <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in patients waiting for transplantation <br>and consider <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy. Therapy with low molecular weight <br>heparin and vitamin K antagonists has been shown to achieve complete and <br>partial recanalization in 33-45% and 15-35% of cases respectively. There are <br>however, no guidelines to help determine the dose and therapeutic efficacy <br>of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in patients with cirrhosis. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy <br>related bleeding is the most feared complication but it appears that the <br>risk of variceal bleeding is more likely to be dependent on portal pressure <br>rather than solely related to coagulation status. TIPS has also been <br>reported to restore patency of the portal vein. Patients with complete <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>currently do not form an absolute contraindication for liver <br>transplantation. Thrombectomy or thromboendovenectomy is possible in more <br>than 75% of patients followed by anatomical end-to-end portal anastomosis. <br>When patency of the portal vein and/or superior mesenteric vein is not <br>achieved, only non-anatomical techniques (reno-portal anastomosis or <br>cavo-portal hemitransposition) can be performed. These techniques, which do <br>not fully reverse portal hypertension, are associated with higher morbidity <br>and mortality risks in the short term.<br><br>RECORD 321<br>Efficacy and safety of the anticoagulant drug, danaparoid sodium, in the <br>treatment of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in patients with <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span><br>Naeshiro N.

Methods: A consecutive 26 cirrhotic patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> were <br>enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. The etiologies of cirrhosis <br>were hepatitis B virus-related, hepatitis C virus-related, alcoholic and <br>cryptogenic in five, 14, three and four patients, respectively. Child-Pugh <br>grade A, B and C was noted in 13, eight and five patients, respectively. <br>Patients were treated with 2 weeks' administration of danaparoid sodium <br>followed by the evaluation of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> reduction and adverse events. Results: All <br>patients experienced reduction of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> through the treatment. The median <br>volume of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> before and after treatment was 2.40cm(3) (range, 0.18-16.63) <br>and 0.37cm(3) (range, 0-5.74), respectively. The median reduction rate of <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span> volume was 77.3% (range, 18-100%). According to the reduction rate, <br>complete reduction (CR), partial reduction (PR, ≥50%) and stable disease <br>(SD, &#60;50%) were observed in four (15%), 16 (62%) and six patients (23%), <br>respectively.

Date of Publication: <br>February 2014<br><br>Introduction: The Budd-Chiari Syndrome (BCS) is a rare and life-threatening <br>disorder caused by the obstruction of hepatic venous outflow. The clinical <br>presentation of BCS can range from the absence of symptoms to the <br>development of end-stage liver disease or fulminant liver failure. Areas <br>covered: This review provides an overview of the available treatments for <br>BCS. Long-term <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> is mandatory in all patients with BCS. The <br>need for an additional intervention, such as hepatic vein angioplasty, <br>thrombolysis, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, surgical shunts <br>or liver transplantation depends on the severity of symptoms and response to <br>treatment. Due to the low prevalence of the disease, knowledge of management <br>of BCS is mostly based on retrospective series and expert opinion and <br>hampered the development of randomized controlled trials. Expert opinion: <br>Outcome of BCS has improved in the last decades, mainly due to the increased <br>suspicion and early treatment instauration; the frequent recognition of an <br>underlying systemic prothrombotic disorder and its ensuing adequate <br>treatment; the widespread use of long-term <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> and the <br>implementation of a stepwise management strategy based on the clinical <br>response to the previous step of treatment.

Date of Publication: 21 Jan 2014<br><br>Background: Treatment of non-malignant <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) in <br>patients with cirrhosis has been neglected in the past because of the fear <br>of bleeding complications when using <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> and due to the <br>technical difficulties associated with the implantation of the transjugular <br>intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). However, <span style="color: red">PVT</span> has a negative impact <br>on outcome and compromises liver transplantation, warranting treatment by <br>using <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> and TIPS. Methods: This review considers studies on <br>the treatment of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in cirrhosis published in the last 10 years. <br>Unfortunately, many of these studies are limited by their retrospective <br>design and a small sample size. Results: <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> using <br>low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or vitamin K antagonists is effective in <br>the treatment of patients with limited and recent <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, resulting in a <br>recanalization in up to 50% of the patients. TIPS (plus local measures) <br>results in a recanalization of up to 100% and reduces the rebleeding rate <br>considerably in patients with recent or chronic <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Conclusion: Based on <br>the presently limited knowledge, a therapy algorithm is suggested favouring <br>the TIPS as a first-line treatment for <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in patients with symptomatic <br>portal hypertension. Patients with thus far asymptomatic portal hypertension <br>may first receive <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, preferably using LMWH. If these patients <br>have a condition where <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> is not promising (complete, extended, <br>chronic <span style="color: red">PVT</span>) or ineffective, or if they are candidates for liver <br>transplantation, the TIPS may be implanted without delay.<br><br>RECORD 325<br>Nonsurgical therapeutic options in <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span><br>Schultheiß M. Bettinger D. Thimme R.<br>Viszeralmedizin: Gastrointestinal Medicine and Surgery (2014) 30:6 <br>(388-392). Date of Publication: 21 Jan 2014<br><br>Background: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is a rare but severe vascular <br>disorder with an acute and a chronic course. Most patients have underlying <br><span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span>; furthermore, thrombophilia is an important risk factor. <br>However, idiopathic forms are also known. Methods: This review discusses <br>nonsurgical treatment options in <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Results and Conclusion: Therapy of <br>acute <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is based on <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> with heparin that is switched to oral <br>anticoagulants, if applicable. Catheter-guided invasive therapy should be <br>considered; however, patients with <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> should be screened for <br>portal hypertension before <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> is mandatory. Therapy of chronic <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span> is discussed controversially; therefore, a strict patient selection and <br>an individual therapeutic decision are warranted depending on the etiology <br>of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Special forms of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> including septic and malignant thrombosis as <br>well as <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in patients waiting for liver transplantation require particular <br>therapy algorithms.<br><br>RECORD 326<br>Analysis of factors associated with <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in pediatric <br>living donor liver transplant recipients<br>Neto J.S.

Date of Publication: 1 Oct <br>2014<br><br>The technique of vascular reconstruction plays a major role in the outcome <br>of living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). An increased use of vascular <br>grafts (VGs) as replacements for sclerotic portal veins has become a <br>standard technique for our group. The aim of this study was to analyze the <br>factors associated with <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) in pediatric LDLT. We <br>performed a retrospective analysis of 486 primary pediatric LDLT procedures <br>performed between October 1995 and May 2013. VGs used for portal <br>reconstruction included living donor inferior mesenteric veins, living donor <br>ovarian veins, recipient internal jugular veins, deceased donor iliac <br>arteries, and deceased donor iliac veins. Thirty-four patients (7.0%) <br>developed <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. The incidence of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> dropped from 10.1% to 2%; the overall <br>utilization of VGs increased from 3.5% to 37.1%. In a multivariate analysis, <br>only the use of VGs remained an independent risk factor for the occurrence <br>of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> (hazard ratio=7.2, 95% confidence interval=2.8-18.7, P<0.001).

Date of Publication: 2014<br><br>The BCR-ABL1 negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are associated <br>with an increased risk of both venous and arterial thromboembolic events. <br>Thromboses may be the presenting clinical feature of an MPN or may occur <br>during the course of the disease. Treatment comprises anticoagulant and <br>antiaggregant agents as in non- MPN thromboses, and treatment of the <br>particular MPN. The duration of anticoagulant treatment that is required for <br>MPN thrombosis is unknown. This study was performed to survey the opinion of <br>hematologists who treat patients with MPN regarding the duration of <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> or antiaggregant therapy in patients in whom thrombosis is <br>the presenting feature of MPN. Five clinical scenarios in which <br>thromboembolism (cerebral vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, <br>cerebrovascular accident, splanchnic vein thrombosis, portal vein <br>thrombosis) was a presenting feature of MPN were created using a web-based <br>tool and were sent by email to hematologists in Israel, Italy and England <br>and to hematologists identified as key opinion leaders in the field of MPN. <br>Physicians were asked to recommend duration of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> and/or <br>aspirin use choosing from 4 alternatives provided. Seventy-three physicians <br>responded to the survey. 42 physicians considered MPNs to be their main area <br>of clinical interest, and 31 did not. 21 physicians saw more than 20 MPN <br>patients per week, and 50 physicians had been in hematology practice for <br>more than 10 years. Responses regarding the duration of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>and/or the use of aspirin varied for all of the clinical vignettes. Neither <br>physician area-of-interest, volume of MPN patients treated nor years in <br>practice were related to the responses obtained. This study demonstrates <br>that hematologists, including those specializing in MPNs, lack consensus in <br>their approach to the long-term treatment of thromboses as the presenting <br>feature of an MPN.

Date of <br>Publication: 2014<br><br>Background/Aims: Portal-vein thrombosis (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) develops in 10–25% of <br>cirrhotic patients and may aggravate portal hypertension. There are few data <br>regarding the effects of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> on nonmalignant <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in liver <br>cirrhosis. The aim of this study was to elucidate the safety, efficacy, and <br>predictors of response to <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy in cirrhotic patients. <br>Methods: Patients with <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> and nonmalignant <span style="color: red">PVT</span> were identified <br>by a hospital electronic medical record system (called BESTCARE). Patients <br>with malignant <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, Budd-Chiari syndrome, underlying primary hematologic <br>disorders, or preexisting extrahepatic thrombosis were excluded from the <br>analysis. Patients were divided into two groups (treatment and <br>nontreatment), and propensity score matching analysis was performed to <br>identify control patients. The sizes of the thrombus and spleen were <br>evaluated using multidetector computed tomography. Results: Twenty-eight <br>patients were enrolled in this study between 2003 and 2014: 14 patients who <br>received warfarin for nonmalignant <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and 14 patients who received no <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. After 112 days of treatment, 11 patients exhibited <br>significantly higher response rates (complete in 6 and partial in 5) <br>compared to the control patients, with decreases in thrombus size of >30%. <br>Compared to nonresponders, the 11 responders were older, and had a thinner <br>spleen and fewer episodes of previous endoscopic variceal ligations, whereas <br>pretreatment liver function and changes in prothrombin time after <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> did not differ significantly between the two groups. Two <br>patients died after warfarin therapy, but the causes of death were not <br>related to <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. Conclusions: Warfarin can be safely administered <br>to cirrhotic patients with nonmalignant <span style="color: red">PVT</span>.

Date of Publication: <br>2014<br><br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in cirrhosis is a relatively common complication <br>associated with the presence of an accompanying prothrombotic phenotype of <br>advanced cirrhosis. The consequences of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> are relevant <br>because it can be associated with impaired hepatic function, might <br>contraindicate hepatic transplantation and could increase morbidity in the <br>surgical procedure. There is controversy concerning the most effective <br>treatment of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>, which is based on information that is <br>seldom robust and whose primary objective is to achieve a return to vessel <br>patency. Various studies have suggested that starting <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>therapy early is associated with portal vein repatency more frequently than <br>without treatment and has a low rate of complications. There are no proven <br>data on the type of anticoagulant (low-molecular-weight heparins or <br>dicoumarin agents) and the treatment duration. The implementation of TIPS is <br>technically feasible in thrombosis without cavernous transformation and is <br>associated with portal vein recanalization in a significant proportion of <br>cases. Thrombolytic therapy does not appear to present an adequate balance <br>between efficacy and safety; its use is therefore not supported for this <br>indication. The proper definition of treatment for <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> <br>requires properly designed studies to delimit the efficacy and safety of the <br>various alternatives. © 2014 Elsevier España, S.L.<br><br>RECORD 333<br>Unexpected disappearance of portal cavernoma on long-term <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span><br>Silva-Junior G.

Although the hemostatic changes in the chronic liver disease <br>patients and the factors that may predict bleeding vs thrombotic <br>complications remains an area of active research, it is believed that the <br>coagulation cascade is delicately balanced in these patients because of <br>parallel reduced hepatic synthesis of pro and anticoagulant factors. <br>Thrombotic state in cirrhotic patients is responsible for not only portal or <br>non-portal thrombosis [deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism <br>(PE)]; it has also been associated with progression of liver fibrosis.

Study design: A retrospective cohort <br>study was performed in 281 patients who underwent hepatic resections for <br>liver cancers from 2011 to 2013. These patients were divided into two <br>groups; an enoxaparin (-) group (n = 228) and an enoxaparin (+) group (n = <br>53). Short-term surgical results including venous thromboembolism (VTE) and <br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) were compared. Results: In the enoxaparin (+) <br>group, the patients' age (65 vs. 69 years; p = 0.01) and BMI (22.9 vs. 24.4; <br>p < 0.01) were significantly higher.

Date of Publication: <br>April 2014<br><br>Purpose Children with chronic ulcerative colitis (CUC) are at increased risk <br>for venous thromboembolism, especially after colectomy procedures. We aim to <br>review our patients with CUC who underwent a colectomy and suffered <br>intra-abdominal thrombosis; moreover we wanted to define thrombotic <br>incidence and outcomes Methods In this is IRB approved retrospective study, <br>we reviewed our patients who underwent colectomy for CUC from January 1999 <br>to December 2011 for development of intra-abdominal thrombosis. Results Of <br>366 patients with CUC who underwent colectomy, 15 (4%) were diagnosed with a <br>venous thromboembolism. All patients presented with acute abdominal pain. <br>The locations of thrombus formation varied: 13 (87%) developed thrombi in <br>the portal vein, 4 (27%) in the splenic vein, 2 (13%) in the superior <br>mesenteric vein, 1 (7%) in the hepatic vein, and 1 (7%) in the hepatic <br>artery. The mean number of post-operative days at diagnosis of thrombus was <br>38.7 days (range 3-180 days). Fourteen patients (93%) underwent <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> for treatment. The mean number of days of anticoagulant <br>therapy until documented resolution of thrombus on imaging was 96.3 days <br>(range 14-364 days). All thrombi resolved with therapy.

Although <br>anticoagulants were immediately administered, thromboses of the portal, <br>mesenteric, and splenic veins were diagnosed by contrast-enhanced computed <br>tomography after 10 days. Complete recanalization of the portal venous <br>system confirmed by contrast-enhanced computed tomography was achieved by <br>administering warfarin orally for 3 months. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Date of <br>Publication: July 2014<br><br>With advances in modern imaging techniques, <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is <br>being increasingly diagnosed. It has a wide ranging clinical spectrum from <br>being an asymptomatic state to a potentially life-threatening situation. It <br>is not unusual to find it as an incidental finding in the abdominal imagings <br>done for other reasons. It is commonly associated with cirrhosis and <br>abdominal malignancies and also has a strong association with prothrombotic <br>disorders. It is often difficult for the clinicians to decide whether <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is <br>acute or chronic. This poses great challenges to its management strategies <br>that include anticoagulants, thrombolysis, and surgical options. Timely <br>diagnosis and appropriate management have great bearings on its outcomes of <br>morbidity and mortality. In this clinician-oriented review, we have provided <br>a concise review of clinical aspects of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and discussed various management <br>strategies while addressing the common questions that come to a physician's <br>mind dealing with such a patient. © 2013 The Author(s).<br><br>RECORD 343<br>Imaging in clinical decision-making for <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span><br>Berzigotti A.

Date <br>of Publication: May 2014<br><br>Thrombosis of the portal venous system is a frequent and potentially <br>life-threatening condition that can take place in a number of different <br>clinical settings including <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span>, hepatocellular carcinoma, other <br>solid tumours, abdominal septic foci, acute pancreatitis, haematological <br>malignancies and congenital or acquired prothrombotic disorders.

Li J.-W. Chen J. Fan Y.-D. Guo P. Zheng S.-G.<br>Journal of Laparoendoscopic and Advanced Surgical Techniques (2014) 24:9 <br>(612-616). Date of Publication: 1 Sep 2014<br><br>Objective: To investigate the effects and technical points of laparoscopic <br>splenectomy and esophagogastric devascularization (LS+ED) for portal <br>hypertension (PH) due to <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span>. Subjects and Methods: In total, <br>204 PH patients who underwent LS+ED from January 2008 to April 2013 in the <br>Southwest Hospital of the Third Military Medical University were enrolled in <br>this study. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data and the key <br>technical points and compared the results with other researchers. Results: <br>LS+ED was successfully carried out on 188 patients. The mean duration of <br>surgery was 232±59 minutes, the mean intraoperative blood loss was 189±137 <br>mL, the rate of blood transfusion was 19.6% (40/204), and no deaths occurred <br>during surgery. The mean postoperative interval to passing of flatus was <br>3.5±0.9 days, and the mean postoperative hospital stay was 8.7±2.2 days. <br>Operative complications occurred in 100 patients, of whom 78 had portal vein <br>system thrombosis (PVST). During a postoperative follow-up period of 2-65 <br>months, 15 cases were lost to follow-up, esophagogastric variceal bleeding <br>re-occurred in 7 patients, encephalopathy occurred in 2 patients, and <br>secondary liver cancer occurred in 3 patients. Five patients died during <br>this period. Conclusions: The technical points of LS+ED include a combined <br>surgical approach, a reasonable surgical procedure, and an appropriate <br>laparoscopic operating plane. LS+ED is a safe and effective treatment for <br>minimal trauma and rapid recovery. PVST is a common and potentially <br>life-threatening complication after LS+ED, and <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy <br>should be given early.<br><br>RECORD 346<br>Idiopathic portal hypertension: Natural history and long-term outcome<br>Siramolpiwat S.

Date of Publication: June 2014<br><br>Idiopathic portal hypertension (IPH) is a rare cause of intrahepatic portal <br>hypertension. Data on natural history and prognosis of IPH are limited. We <br>sought to describe the complications and long-tem outcome of IPH by <br>retrospectively studying 69 biopsy-proven cases of IPH. Mean duration of <br>follow-up was 6.7±4.6 years. All patients had evidence of portal <br>hypertension (PH) at diagnosis, and 42% were symptomatic. Variceal bleeding <br>(VB) was the most common manifestation. In those without bleeding at <br>diagnosis, 74% had varices at first endoscopy. In those with large varices, <br>the 1-year probability of first bleeding despite primary prophylaxis was 9%. <br>The 1-year probability of rebleeding was 22%. Ascites and hepatic <br>encephalopathy was documented in 26% and 7% of patients, respectively, at <br>least once during the clinical course. The 1-year probability of developing <br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) was 9%, and 53% of patients receiving <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> achieved recanalization. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) <br>infection and VB at diagnosis were the independent predictors of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Seven <br>patients died (6 as a result of an IPH-related cause) and 2 were <br>transplanted. Probability of liver transplantation-free survival was 82% at <br>10 years. Presence of a severe associated disorder and ascites as a <br>presenting symptom were associated with poor survival. Conclusion: Variceal <br>bleeding is a major complication of IPH. Using, in IPH patients, the same <br>management approach for PH as in cirrhosis is safe and maintains a low <br>incidence of first bleeding and rebleeding in IPH patients. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is a <br>frequent complication, particularly in those with HIV infection.

OBJECTIVE To <br>describe the use of segmental allograft in the current era of donor <br>scarcity, minimizing vascular complications using innovative surgical <br>techniques. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective study from <br>August 2007 to August 2012 at a university hospital. A total of 218 <br>consecutive liver transplant patients were reviewed, and 69 patients (31.6%; <br>38 males and 31 females; mean age, 22.5 years) received segmental grafts <br>from living donors or split/reduced-size grafts from deceased donors. MAIN <br>OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Graft type, vascular and biliary complications, and <br>patient and graft survival. RESULTS Of 69 segmental transplants, 47 were <br>living donor liver transplants: 13 grafts (27.7%) were right lobes, 22 <br>(46.8%) were left lobes, and 12 (25.5%) were left lateral segments. <br>Twenty-two patients received deceased donor segmental grafts; of these, 11 <br>(50.0%) were extended right lobes, 9 (40.9%) were left lateral segments, 1 <br>(4.5%) was a right lobe, and 1 (4.5%) was a left lobe. Arterial anastomoses <br>were done using 8-0 monofilament sutures in an interrupted fashion for <br>living donor graft recipients and for pediatric patients. Most patients <br>received a prophylactic dose of low-molecular-weight heparin for a week and <br>aspirin indefinitely. There was no incidence of hepatic artery or portal <br>vein thrombosis. Two patients developed hepatic artery stenosis and were <br>treated with balloon angioplasty by radiology. Graft and patient survivals <br>were 96% and 98%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Use of segmental <br>allografts is essential to offer timely transplantation and decrease waiting <br>list mortality. Living donor liver transplants and segmental grafts from <br>deceased donors are complementary. It is possible to have excellent outcomes <br>combining a multidisciplinary team approach, technical expertise, routine <br>use of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, and strict patient and donor selection.

Xia J. Li D. Lu Y. Wang B.<br>Journal of Surgical Research (2013) 185:2 (934-939). Date of Publication: <br>December 2013<br><br>Background: The incidence of vascular injury after a cholecystectomy is <br>often underestimated. Although injuries to the portal vein are rare, they <br>are devastating. The aim of the present study was to analyze suitable <br>therapeutic strategies regarding portal vein injury in the absence of <br>biliary injury. Materials and methods: Eleven patients with portal vein <br>injuries after laparoscopic or open cholecystectomy were referred to our <br>hospital between 2004 and 2010. The clinical presentation, diagnosis, and <br>management of patients with severe portal vein injuries were reviewed. All <br>the patients were discharged without outstanding clinical conditions. During <br>retrospective analysis, these patients were divided into early, middle, and <br>late stages. Results: All the 11 patients had a portal vein and/or right <br>hepatic artery injury, but no biliary injuries were observed. Among these <br>patients, different management strategies were managed according to the <br>stage of the injury. Eight patients received a direct suture at the time of <br>injury by an experienced hepatobiliary surgeon. Two patients received <br>thrombolytic and <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy after cholecystectomy, without <br>additional surgery. One patient received a liver transplant 3 mo after the <br>injury. After long-term follow-up, these patients had no clinical <br>conditions. Conclusions: Direct repair or suture is important during the <br>early stage of portal vein injury. Conservative thrombolytic and <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy may serve an important role in the treatment of <br>acute massive thrombus in portal vein injury during the middle stage. Liver <br>transplantation is a salvage therapy that should be used during the late <br>stage. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Materials and <br>Methods From January 2006 to December 2011, 145 patients with hypersplenism <br>caused by cirrhotic portal hypertension underwent PSE. In 11 cases, <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was <br>detected 13-42 days after PSE. Among the 11 patients, 5 underwent <br>anticoagulant therapy because of clinical symptoms, and 6 did not receive <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> because they were symptom-free (4 patients) or experienced <br>variceal bleeding (2 patients). The long-term follow-up data from these 11 <br>patients were analyzed retrospectively. Results The 11 patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> had <br>a mean splenic infarction ratio of 71.5%. The mean duration of follow-up was <br>37.6 months. During the follow-up period, none of the 5 patients who <br>underwent <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> developed variceal hemorrhage despite presenting <br>with large esophagogastric varices. Four of the five patients achieved <br>complete resolution of thrombosis, and one did not develop thrombus <br>progression. However, among the 6 patients who did not undergo <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, 2 developed esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage secondary <br>to thrombus progression, 3 developed cavernous transformation of the portal <br>vein and variceal progression, and 1 had partial calcification of the <br>thrombus. Two patients who had variceal bleeding or rebleeding underwent a <br>transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. Complete recanalization of <br>the portal vein was achieved after the procedures.

MATERIALS AND METHODS. A retrospective search of the <br>department of radiology's MRI database of examinations performed from <br>October 2006 through December 2010 for "<span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>" and <br>"cirrhosis" and "hepatocellular cancer" was performed. Patients who <br>underwent diagnostic DWI and had thrombus shown to be rapidly (< 3 months) <br>increasing in size despite <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy were considered to have <br>malignant <span style="color: red">PVT</span> (n = 16 cases) and patients with MRI findings showing <br>stability or reduction in the extent of thrombus over a 12-month follow-up <br>were considered to have benign <span style="color: red">PVT</span> (n = 20 cases). Two blinded and <br>independent reviewers analyzed the DW images and conventional MR images. <br>RESULTS. There was no difference in the distribution of patients by age (p = <br>0.25) or sex (p = 0.68) between the benign and malignant <span style="color: red">PVT</span> groups. On <br>multivariate analysis, the only parameter to predict the type of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was the <br>size of HCC (p = 0.05); other parameters were excluded from the model. There <br>was substantial overlap in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values and <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span>/liver ADC ratios of benign <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and malignant <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. The presence of at <br>least two of the three following MRI findings had a sensitivity of 100% and <br>specificity of 90% for the diagnosis of malignant <span style="color: red">PVT</span>: distance from tumor <br>to <span style="color: red">PVT</span> of less than 2 cm, HCC size of greater than 5 cm, and arterial <br>enhancement of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. CONCLUSION. Signal-intensity characteristics on DWI and <br>measured ADC values do not reliably differentiate benign <span style="color: red">PVT</span> from malignant <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span>.

Date of Publication: August 2011<br><br>Introduction: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is thrombosis that develops in <br>the trunk of the portal vein which can extend to its branches. It results <br>from a combination of local and systemic prothrombotic factors. Methods: We <br>describe 2 cases for this study. Patient 1 is a 77-year-old male who was <br>admitted for cholangitis and pancreatitis and was found to have an <br>incidental <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Patient 1’s investigations and laboratory workup: total <br>white count 23.0x10(9)/L (neutrophils 91.6%), haemoglobin 11.7g/dL, <br>platelets 147x10(9)/L; total bilirubin 184umol/L, alanine transaminase <br>111U/L, aspartate transaminase 113 U/L, gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase 515 <br>U/L; amylase 641 U/L; hepatitis screening was negative. Abdominal computed <br>tomography (CT) scan showed cholangitis with common bile duct calculi and an <br>incidental thrombosis of the segmental branches of the right portal vein. <br>Thrombophilia screen was negative. Patient 2 is a 60-year-old female with <br>child’s B cryptogenic <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> and was admitted for gastroenteritis <br>and left breast lump. She was found to have an incidental non-occlusive <br>thrombus in the main portal vein. Her investigations and laboratory workup <br>were as follows: total white cell 6.2x10(9)/L (neutrophils 73.1%), <br>haemoglobin 9.1g/dL, platelets 116x10(9)/L; Na 133 mmol/L, K 4.6 mmol/L, <br>creatinine 115 umol/L; albumin 29g/L, total bilirubin 25 umol/L, alanine <br>transaminase 27U/L, aspartate transaminase 42 U/L, C-reactive protein <br>15.5mg/L. CT scan showed left breast mass, cirrhosis with portal <br>hypertension and non-occlusive portal vein thrombus. Results: Patient 1 <br>underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), removal of <br>stones and was given antibiotics. Patient was not anticoagulated due to the <br>ongoing infection. A repeat CT scan 6 months later showed no evidence of <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Patient 2 underwent peritoneal drainage and was given antibiotics. No <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was given due to low platelet count. Eleven months later, an <br>ultrasound Doppler of the hepatobiliary system revealed no evidence of <br>vascular thrombosis. The left breast mass was later noted to be an invasive <br>adenocarcinoma. Conclusion: The decision to anticoagulate a patient with <br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> depends on several factors.

Date of Publication: November 2013<br><br>OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to estimate outcomes of splanchnic vein <br>thrombosis (SVT) in hospitalized patients with acute pancreatitis (AP). <br>METHODS: This was a retrospective study (January 1996 to December 2006) via <br>chart review. RESULTS: Over 10 years, 1.8% (45/2454) of patients with AP <br>with a mean (SD) age of 58 (15) years were diagnosed with SVT. Splenic vein <br>thrombosis was the most common form of SVT (30/45 patients, 67%). Seventeen <br>patients were anticoagulated with heparin, when the SVT was diagnosed in the <br>acute stage followed by oral <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> (AC). The thrombosis that was <br>most commonly anticoagulated was <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in 11 (65%) of 17 <br>patients. Of 17 patients in the AC group, 2 (12%) showed recanalization as <br>compared with 3 (11%) of 28 patients in the non-AC group (P > 0.05). The <br>mortality was 3 (7%) of 45 (2 from the AC group versus 1 in the non-AC <br>group, P > 0.05). Two of these died of multiorgan failure, and the other, <br>from septic shock. None of the deaths were due to bleeding complications. <br>CONCLUSIONS: Splanchnic vein thrombosis occurred in 1.8% patients of AP. The <br>use of AC was reasonably safe with no fatal bleeding complications. However, <br>there was no significant difference in the recanalization rates in those <br>with and without AC.

Konjeti R. Aggarwal A. Lopez R. Atreja A. Miller C. Zein N.N. <br>Carey W.D.<br>Annals of Hepatology (2013) 12:6 (952-958). Date of Publication: <br>November/December 2013<br><br>Background and aims. Most portal vein thromboses (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) in cirrhotics are <br>discovered incidentally. While case series demonstrate improved portal vein <br>patency with anti-coagulation, there is little information on impact of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>on morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to compare morbidity and <br>mortality in cirrhotics with untreated <span style="color: red">PVT</span> with those without <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Material <br>and methods. Cirrhotics evaluated for orthotopic liver transplant in a <br>single large transplant center were prospectively followed. Subjects had <br>contrast CT or MRI at initial evaluation and serial imaging every 6 months <br>until transplantation, removal from the list or death. Univariate and <br>multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to assess associations <br>between new <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and factors of interest. Results. Of the 290 prospectively <br>followed cirrhotics who met inclusion criteria, <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was detected in 70 <br>(24.1%)-47 had <span style="color: red">PVT</span> at the time of initial evaluation and 23 developed one <br>during the pre-transplant study period. A third of the patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> had <br>re-canalization or spontaneous resolution of thrombus while awaiting <br>transplantation. There was no difference in the pre or posttransplant <br>mortality between cirrhotics with and without <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Conclusion. Cirrhotics <br>with untreated <span style="color: red">PVT</span> fared equally well as those without <span style="color: red">PVT</span> before and after <br>transplantation.

Shortridge J. Raza S. Nistala P. Huffman B.M. Wang M.X. Xiang D.<br>Oncology Letters (2013) 6:5 (1261-1264). Date of Publication: November 2013<br><br>Catastrophic antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (CAPS) is characterized by <br>fulminant thrombosis of the arterial and venous beds of multiple organ <br>systems over a relatively short period of time and with a high mortality <br>rate. Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma of the lung has <br>never been reported as a causative or precipitating factor for CAPS in the <br>CAPS registry database. The present study describes a rare case of pulmonary <br>MALT lymphoma of the lung that presented as CAPS. A 19-year-old Hispanic <br>female presented with shortness of breath and abdominal pain. Computed <br>tomography (CT) scans of the chest and abdomen revealed multiple portal vein <br>thromboses and bilateral pulmonary nodules. Within one week of presentation, <br>the patient developed a straight sinus thrombosis and upper extremity deep <br>vein thrombosis, which led to shortness of breath. A biopsy of the lung <br>nodule revealed MALT lymphoma. The present case illustrates a rarely <br>reported pulmonary MALT lymphoma presenting as CAPS in a young female. The <br>patient was successfully treated with 90 mg/m(2) bendamustine on days one <br>and two and rituximab 375 mg/m(2) on day one of each 28-day cycle. Complete <br>remission of the lung nodules was observed following three cycles of <br>treatment, as visualized by positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scan. <br>Fondaparinux was identified as a feasible <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> drug of choice for <br>this case. At seven months post-treatment, the patient continues to be <br>stable with no further evidence of thrombosis and is currently undergoing <br>rituximab maintenance therapy every six months for two years. A repeat lupus <br>anticoagulant antibody assay turned and remained negative during the <br>clinical follow-up period. A prompt diagnosis and early aggressive treatment <br>is potentially curative and may dramatically decrease the mortality risk. <br>Future studies should explore the role of rituximab in the management of <br>CAPS-associated B-cell lymphoid malignancies.<br><br>RECORD 356<br>Risk factors, diagnosis, management, and outcomes for splanchnic vein <br>thrombosis: A retrospective analysis<br>Derman B.A. Kwaan H.C.<br>Blood (2013) 122:21. Date of Publication: 21 Oct 2013<br><br>Background There is a paucity of data on the incidence of risk factors for <br>splanchnic vein thrombosis in current published literature. The present <br>study is an attempt to determine the risk factors, diagnostic methods <br>employed, treatment modalities, and outcomes in patients with splanchnic <br>vein thrombosis in a single institution over a two-year period. Methods <br>Retrospective chart review of patients, 18-90 years old, who were diagnosed <br>with splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) at a single institution from January <br>1, 2010 to November 10, 2012. They were grouped as those with Budd-Chiari <br>syndrome (BCS) and those with <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>), including those <br>combined with splenic vein thrombosis (S<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) and those with mesenteric vein <br>thrombosis (MVT). Results Among the 246 patients studied, 21 had BCS and 225 <br>had <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Associated risk factors in the order of frequency were liver <br>disease being present in 48% of BCS, 69% of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, 45% of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>+S<span style="color: red">PVT</span>, and 52% of <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span>+MVT. Next was regional cancer, being present in 24%in BCS and 47% of <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Third commonest was pancreatitis being present in 14% of BCS, 9% of <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span>, 18% of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>+S<span style="color: red">PVT</span>, and 6% of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>+MVT. Hereditary thrombophilias were <br>found in 10% of the BCS group and 4% of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>; however, it constituted 18% of <br>the <span style="color: red">PVT</span>+S<span style="color: red">PVT</span> group, and 12% of the <span style="color: red">PVT</span>+MVT group. 10% of patients in both <br>the BCS and <span style="color: red">PVT</span> groups had a liver transplant during their lifetime. The <br>most common presenting symptom was abdominal pain occurring in 57% patients <br>with BCS and 50% patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. The majority had laboratory findings of <br>liver dysfunction at presentation with 86% in BCS group and 78% in <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>group. JAK2 V617F mutation, when tested, was present in 14% of those with <br>BCS, 20% of the <span style="color: red">PVT</span> group, 29% of those with <span style="color: red">PVT</span>+S<span style="color: red">PVT</span> and 22% of those with <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span>+MVT. Diagnosis of SVT was most commonly made by computerized tomography <br>(CT) with contrast (57% for BCS, 56% for <span style="color: red">PVT</span>). Approximately 60% of BCS <br>patients and 30% of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> patients received either short-term or long-term <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>; 20% of both groups received transjugular intrahepatic <br>portal system (TIPS) catheterization. Recurrence of symptoms requiring a <br>second hospitalization occurred in 24% of those with BCS and 15% of patients <br>with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> (36% of the <span style="color: red">PVT</span>+S<span style="color: red">PVT</span> and 27% of the <span style="color: red">PVT</span>+MVT). In those patients <br>with a greater comorbidity profile, including hypertension, diabetes, and <br>malignancy, <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is more likely than BCS to occur. Regional presence of <br>inflammation or cancer, specifically underlying liver disease, <br>hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, pancreatitis, as well as <br>regional surgical procedures appear to play major role in splanchnic vein <br>thrombosis, while hereditary thrombophilias and the JAK2 V617F mutation make <br>up an important but small component of splanchnic vein thrombosis. <br>Contrast-enhanced CT was the most commonly successful radiologic technique <br>for diagnosis, though magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a more <br>accurate alternative. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was largely limited to patients with <br>the most severe cases of SVT, and symptomatic recurrence was also more <br>likely in these populations. Conclusions The present findings of risk <br>factors associated with SVT are at variance with those in the current <br>published literature, with higher incidence of regional cancer and lower <br>incidence of JAK2 V617F mutation. There are, however, limitations to this <br>study, including the fact that this is a retrospective analysis with data <br>from a single institution. Verification of these findings has to been made <br>in a prospective multi-institutional study involving a larger number of <br>patients and a longer period of observation.<br><br>RECORD 357<br>Splanchnic vein thrombosis associated with myeloproliferative neoplasms.

Risk <br>of arterial and venous thrombosis is increased in MPN patients, and <br>thrombosis is one of most important causes of mortality and morbidity. The <br>risk of venous thrombosis in unusual sites, such as splanchnic vessels <br>(SVT), is particularly associated with MPN; SVT can lead to complications <br>such as portal hypertension, esophageal and gastric varices, ascites and <br>hepatic failure. A recent meta-analysis reported that a MPN is the <br>underlying cause of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in 31.5% and of Budd Chiari <br>syndrome in 40.9% of cases (Smalberg, 2012). A significant association of <br>SVT with JAK2V617F mutated MPN was reported (Dentali, 2009) but study of <br>other correlations has been hampered by heterogeneity of available patient <br>cohorts comprising relatively small number of cases. We conducted a <br>retrospective multicenter study collecting clinical and biological data of <br>patients (pts) with SVT associated with MPN diagnosed according to WHO2008 <br>criteria, aiming to describe patients' characteristics, trends and <br>prognostic factors, and their potential implications for clinical practice. <br>Data were collected from 15 international hematology centers in the <br>framework of IWG-MRT. We collected 475 cases of pts with portal, splenic or <br>mesenteric vein thrombosis (75.2%) or Budd Chiari syndrome (24.8%) <br>associated with MPN. In 32% of cases, simultaneous involvement of portal <br>(69.1% of total thrombosis), splenic (30.5%) and mesenteric (25.3%) veins <br>occurred, and in 1.7% they were associated with Budd Chiari syndrome. <br>Frequency of MPN subtype: 38.1% ET (n=181), 34.9% PV (n=166), 16.2% MF <br>(n=77), 10.8% U-MPN (n=51). Median follow-up 87.9 mo (range 0.5-430); female <br>61.3% (n=292; P<0.0001 vs male); median age at MPN diagnosis (dg) 44.4 y <br>(range 12-90), at SVT dg 44.9 y (range 17-85). In 229 cases (48%) MPN and <br>SVT dg were coincident, while in 104 (22%) SVT occurred before MPN dg <br>(median 40 mo, range 5-335) and in 129 (27%) during MPN follow up (median 79 <br>mo, range 5-394). JAK2V617F mutational status is available for 361 pts: 99% <br>PV, 84.7% ET, 88.1% PMF and 92.9% U-MPN pts were JAK2V617F positive, with a <br>mean allele burden of 56±27.4%, 33.1±25.5%, 39.3±19.4% and 23.8±11.9%, <br>respectively. Erythropoietin-independent colonies (EEC) were present at <br>diagnosis in 80/110 evaluated cases (72.7%), 38/47 PV (84.4%), 32/45 ET <br>(71.1%), 8/11 PMF (72.7%) and 2/7 U-MPN (28.6%). A concurrent thrombophilic <br>state was found in 38.9% of cases. A 12.3% of pts experienced a recurrence <br>of SVT after a median of 29 mo (range 1-378.3) and 35.8% developed <br>thrombosis in other sites (17.7% arterial, 19.3% venous). Esophageal varices <br>were found in 70.6% from which 31.9% bled. MF transformation occurred in <br>32/166 PV (19%) and in 23/181 ET (13%) pts, with median time to progression <br>of 122.3 mo (range 5.4-377.3) and 125.1 mo (range 39.3-255.3), respectively. <br>Evolution to acute leukemia (AL) occurred in 12 pts (2.7%), of which 2 PMF, <br>6 PV and 4 ET. In 3 PV and 1 ET pts a PPV and PET-MF transformation occurred <br>before AL. After SVT, 77% of pts received <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, 23.5% <br>antiaggregant therapy and 1.5% both; 68.8% received cytotoxic drugs, 11.4% <br>of pts were treated with trans jugular porto-systemic shunt. No differences <br>in survival were noted with these approaches. Beta blocker therapy was used <br>in 48.5% of pts and correlated with improved survival (p=0.041) At last <br>follow up 70/473 pts (14.8%) died; causes of death are evolution to AL <br>(16.4%), other cancers (14.5%), disease progression without AL (12.7%), SVT <br>(10.9%), hepatic failure and venous thrombosis other than SVT (9.1% each), <br>heart failure and arterial thrombosis (7.3% each), hemorrhage (5.5%), renal <br>failure and infection (3.6% each). After 10 y follow up 8/166 PV (5%), <br>14/181 ET (8%), 14/77 PMF (18%) and 1/51 U-MPN (1.96%) pts died (p<0.01). <br>Survival was significantly affected by occurrence of thrombosis other than <br>SVT (p<0.0001) but not recurrence in splanchnic vessels (p=0.068). This <br>large study confirms the strong association between JAK2V617F-mutated MPN <br>and SVT and identifies the category of U-MPN as the prognostically more <br>favorable; thrombosis at sites outside the splanchnic vasculature remains <br>the leading cause of death.<br><br>RECORD 358<br>Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria with budd-chiari syndrome treated with <br>complement inhibitor eculizumab; a case report<br>Valeri F. Borchiellini A. Schinco P. Boccadoro M.<br>Blood (2013) 122:21. Date of Publication: 21 Oct 2013<br><br>Introduction Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare, acquired <br>haemolytic anaemia caused by somatic mutation in the phosphatidylinositol <br>glycan-complementation class A gene, resulting in absence of a key <br>complement regulatory protein, CD59. Thrombosis occurs in up to 40% of PNH <br>patients; it usually involves abdominal and cerebral veins and it is the <br>leading cause of death disease related. Methods We describe the response to <br>Eculizumab (Soliris, Alexion) in 28 years old male with PNH diagnosed as a <br>consequence of Budd Chiari Syndrome, acute liver dysfunction, mild <br>haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia. Results The patient was admitted to <br>the gastroenterology department with acute abdominal pain, fatigue, <br>hemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia and transaminitis. Abdominal doppler <br>ultrasonography (US) was immediately performed with detection of Budd Chiari <br>Syndrome, <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>, initial portal hypertension and ascites. <br>He was started on low dose low molecular weight heparin (platelets < <br>40x10-9/L), but despite <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> progressive liver damage occurred, <br>with poor pain control and worsening ascites. At the same time, we observed <br>rapid exacerbation of thrombocytopenia and increasing in hemolysis tests <br>with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) reaching 1766 U/L, unresponsive to steroids <br>administration. Bone marrow biopsy was negative but peripheral blood flow <br>cytometry characterized a large PNH clone (85% total red blood cells). <br>Furthermore, liver biopsy identified advanced stage of idiopathic cirrosis. <br>Eculizumab therapy was then initiated at a dose of 600 mg weekly for 4 weeks <br>and then 900 mg every 14 days. During the first month, transaminases <br>progressively normalized and platelets settled permanently above 40x10-9/L, <br>allowing therapeutic dose of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. LDH dropped from basal value <br>of >1000U/L to 600U/L and progressive reduction in abdominal pain was <br>observed. Recanalization of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> was found out at the US <br>doppler after 6 weeks of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, but recanalization of sovraepatic <br>veins was not yet detectable. Conclusions Currently, after 17 Eculizumab <br>administrations, platelets are 44 x 10-9/L, Hb 11.9 g/dl, AST 26 mg/dl, ALT <br>55 mg/dl, GGT 123 mg/dl, LDH 518 U/L. No further thrombotic episodes <br>occurred, no ascites was detected as well as portal hypertension signs, <br>performing ultrasonography monitoring. This case shows that Eculizumab can <br>block intravascular haemolysis and platelet consumption and can improve <br>hepatic failure, allowing full dose of anticoagulant as therapy for current <br>thrombosis or as prophylaxis for future events.<br><br>RECORD 359<br>A phase 2 study of ruxolitinib in patients with splanchnic vein thrombosis <br>associated with myeloproliferative neoplasm.

De Stefano V. Rumi E. Mannarelli C. Fanelli T. Bosi A. <br>Rambaldi A. Barosi G. Cazzola M. Barbui T. Vannucchi A.M.<br>Blood (2013) 122:21. Date of Publication: 21 Oct 2013<br><br>Philadelphia-negative Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPN) include <br>Polycythemia Vera (PV), Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) and Myelofibrosis, <br>both Primary (PMF) and secondary to PV or ET (PPV-MF and PET-MF). A MPN is <br>frequently the underlying cause of splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT), <br>accounting for 31.5% of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) and 40.9% of Budd <br>Chiari syndrome (BCS). In patients (pts) with MPN and SVT, splenomegaly can <br>arise as the consequence of the hematological disease and/or blood flow <br>abnormalities consequent to the thrombosis itself. Splenomegaly and the <br>compensatory enlarged splanchnic vessels are responsible for several <br>complications including esophageal and gastric varices. Splenomegaly may <br>cause abdominal discomfort; furthermore pts may present symptomatic burden <br>due to the MPN. Current treatment strategies for MPN pts with SVT include <br>anticoagulants and cytoreductive therapy (ie hydroxyurea, interferon) that <br>have little influence in the control of splenomegaly and symptoms and do not <br>improve flow abnormalities. Ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, was highly <br>effective in reducing spleen volume and improving symptoms in patients with <br>MF and PV in phase II and III studies. We hypothesized that the decrease of <br>the enlarged spleen determined by Ruxolitinib could result in a reduction of <br>the local pressure in splanchnic vessels, producing both symptomatic <br>improvement of splenomegaly-related symptoms and of splanchnic circulation. <br>We designed an investigator-initiated multicentre phase 2 study of <br>Ruxolitinib in pts with splenomegaly due to an underlying MPN associated <br>with SVT. The drug was provided free of charge by Novartis, that had no role <br>in trial design nor in data analysis. The primary study objective was to <br>evaluate the proportion of subjects achieving ≥ 50% reduction in spleen <br>length from left costal margin (LCM) measured by palpation at any time from <br>baseline to week 24 (w24) and at w24, or a ≥ 35% reduction in spleen volume <br>by MRI or CT at week 24. The secondary objectives included: evaluation of <br>safety of Ruxolitinib in MPN-associated SVT; assessment of splanchnic <br>circulation through Doppler analysis, measurement of hyperdynamic arterial <br>circulation by echocardiography and stiffness of hepatic/splenic parenchyma <br>by fibroscan; status of esophageal varices at w24 compared to baseline. <br>Quality of Life assessment was performed using MPN-SAF questionnaire. <br>Exploratory objectives include evaluations of changes in JAK2V617F or <br>MPLW515 allelic burden, association of baseline mutations with response to <br>treatment, changes in cytokine and microRNAs profiles, quantification of <br>circulating endothelial cells. At the time of abstract submission 7 out of <br>21 pts have been enrolled, of which 5 completed the 24 weeks of treatment; <br>two additional pts are in screening phase. Three pts had PMF, two ET, one PV <br>and one PPV-MF, associated to spleno-porto-mesenteric thrombosis (5 pts) and <br>Budd Chiari syndrome (2 pts). All pts were under oral <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>therapy. Initial dose of Ruxolitinib was 10 mg BID for PV, 25 mg BID for ET, <br>15 mg BID for MF pts with baseline platelet count of 100 to 200x109/L and 20 <br>mg BID for those with baseline platelet count >200x109/L. A palpable <br>splenomegaly greater than 5 cm below LCM was a criterion for enrollment; the <br>5 patients who completed the 24 weeks of treatment had a median splenomegaly <br>of 8 cm below LCM at baseline, and obtained a median reduction of 69% <br>measured by palpation at week 24, associated with a significant reduction in <br>abdominal discomfort as measured by MPN-SAF questionnaire (median score at <br>screening 5 vs 1.5 at week 24). The total symptom score calculated by using <br>BFI and MPN-SAF was reduced from 50 at screening to 35 at week 24. <br>Instrumental evaluations of splanchnic and systemic circulation showed that <br>3 pts obtained a reduction of the spleen stiffness from a median value of 66 <br>to 49.6 kilopascals (KPa), 2 pts had a reduction of the liver stiffness from <br>a median value of 23.85 to 18.2 KPa and 1 pt a reduction of the cardiac <br>output from 5.871 to 4.6 L/min. Evaluation of esophageal varices at week 24 <br>showed stabilization with neither worsening nor need of banding. Ruxolitinib <br>was well tolerated, with no SAE reported; one pt developed anemia G2 and one <br>G3 leading to dose reduction. Other adverse events include G1 asthenia and <br>G≤2 AST/ALT increase in 3 pts, one case of Herpes Zoster and one case of <br>abdominal pain both G1.

Brockman A.<br>Blood (2013) 122:21. Date of Publication: 21 Oct 2013<br><br>Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is of the BCR-ABL-Negative myeloproliferative <br>neoplasms (MPN). The incidence of ET is approximately 2.5 in every 100,000 <br>person per year. However, given the good prognosis, associated long life <br>expectancy increasing detection in younger populations,ET is associated with <br>a higher prevalence rate estimated to be 24 in every 100,000 person per <br>year. ET is characterized by thrombocytosis, vasomotor symptoms a variable <br>but increased risk of thrombosis and bleeding. Half of all ET patients will <br>have a positive JAK2 and/or MPL mutation(s). Extramedullary hematopoiesis <br>(EMH) is not a common finding in ET. Nonetheless, ET and other MPNs are <br>associated with the mobilization of CD34+ cells into the peripheral blood. <br>This process can ultimately lead to the seeding of extramedullary sites with <br>primitive hematopoietic capacity, resulting in EMH within the spleen and <br>liver, as well as a variety of other organs. Herein we describe a case that <br>presented with life-threatening thrombosis and was found to have hepatic EMH <br>several months prior to a clinical and pathologic diagnosis of ET. Case <br>description A 22 year-old woman presented 10 days post Cesarean section with <br>abdominal pain and hematemesis. Abdominal imaging showed hepatomegaly, <br>splenomegaly, along with splenic and <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. The patient <br>underwent an emergency surgical splenectomy due to severe portal <br>hypertension and endoscopic evidence of gastric variceal bleeding. A random <br>liver biopsy was also performed intra-operatively. The splenectomy resulted <br>in resolution of the GI bleeding and the varices normalized on follow up. <br>Her platelet count was normal at the time of operation, but post-splenectomy <br>her platelet count peaked at 1,217 K/ μL. Extensive testing did not unravel <br>any identifiable inherited and/or acquired hypercoaguable factors. <br>Subsequently <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy was recommended for 6 months. On <br>pathology review, the spleen histology showed congestion, but otherwise no <br>diagnostic abnormalities were noted. The liver biopsy showed evidence of EMH <br>but did not identify any liver parenchymal disease. On subsequent follow up, <br>the patient had persistent and marked thrombocytosis for over a year. A bone <br>marrow biopsy was performed which showed a hypercellular bone marrow and <br>megakaryocytic hyperplasia with a few large forms. There was no dysplasia or <br>significant reticulin fibrosis. JAK2 mutation and BCR-ABL translocation were <br>negative. Hydroxyurea and aspirin were started due to high risk of <br>thrombosis. Discussion We report this unique case in which there was <br>evidence of extramedullary hematopoiesis, along with pathologic and life <br>threatening visceral thrombosis several months before the patient met <br>criteria for diagnosis of ET. This supports the notion that neoplastic cells <br>can mobilize and seed other organs early in the course of MPNs, including <br>ET. Thrombotic risk in MPNs can also occur in the preclinical phase of MPNs <br>as has been suggested in other reports. We also conclude that the <br>demonstration of EMH in individuals with no preexisting hematologic neoplasm <br>should warrant close follow up and assessment.<br><br>RECORD 361<br>Alcoholic pancreatitis-induced extrahepatic portal venous system th rombosis <br>(EPVST): A pair of illustrative cases<br>Patel V. Patel J. Afshari M. Cervellione K. Mehta A.<br>American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013) 108 SUPPL. 1 (S257). Date of <br>Publication: October 2013<br><br>Introduction: Vascular complications of recurrent acute or chronic alcoholic <br>pancreatitis are well-known, including extrahepatic portal venous system <br>thrombosis (EPVST), which occurs at a rate of approximately 13% in this <br>population. The splenic vein is the most commonly affected site in these <br>vascular complications, with the portal and superior mesenteric veins being <br>less common. Prognosis of patients with EPVST depends on early diagnosis and <br>prompt treatment with <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. Here, we present two cases of <br>patients presenting with EPVST, one in the portal vein and one in the <br>splenic vein, illustrating the manifestations and the course of these <br>important clinical entities. Case 1: A 48-year-old, alcoholic, HIV-positive <br>male presented with epigastric pain, severe epigastric tenderness, and <br>nausea. He had a history of admissions for acute alcoholic pancreatitis. <br>Initial blood work showed evidence of hemoconcentration with elevated <br>amylase and lipase levels suggestive of acute pancreatitis. Abdominal CT <br>scan showed pancreatic inflammation with <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (Figure 1). <br>The patient was started on therapeutic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> and treated with <br>aggressive fluid hydration with pain management. The patient improved <br>symptomatically and repeat CT scan 8 weeks later showed resolution of portal <br>vein thrombosis. Case 2: A 37-year-old alcoholic male with multiple past <br>admissions for recurrent pancreatitis presented with epigastric pain, mild <br>epigastric tenderness, nausea, and vomiting for 2 days. Initial labs showed <br>minimal elevations in pancreatic enzyme levels. Abdominal CT scan revealed <br>pancreatic inflammation and calcification with splenic and right common <br>iliac vein thrombosis (Figure 2). Therapeutic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was started <br>with significant improvement in the patient's clinical condition. <br>Conclusion: Despite being a well-known complication of recurrent acute or <br>chronic alcoholic pancreatitis, the exact mechanism(s) causing venous <br>thrombosis in this patient population is unclear. Venous stasis, spasm, and <br>mass effects from inflamed pancreas are three of the possible causes. Prompt <br>treatment with therapeutic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> is essential to prevent <br>complications such as chronic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>, portal venous <br>hypertension, mesenteric ischemia, and infarction. The optimal duration of <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> remains unknown and warrants further study.

Pathophysiology, clinical presentation and prognosis vary according <br>to the site of thrombosis, although showing some common features. <br>Epidemiology The epidemiology of SVT is poorly defined and varies greatly <br>depending on data sources. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is the most common manifestation in the <br>spectrum of SVT, with a reported annual incidence of less than 4 per million <br>people in hospital registry data in the 1980s and a population prevalence of <br>approximately 1% in a recent large autopsy study1. Viceversa, BCS is the <br>least frequent disease, with an incidence ranging from 0.1 to 0.4-0.8 per <br>million people per year (in Japan and Western countries, respectively) and, <br>inversely, a prevalence ranging from 1.4 to 2.4 per million people (in <br>Western countries and Japan, respectively)1. SVT has also a non-negligible <br>rate of asymptomatic incidental findings, in imaging studies performed for <br>other indications, such as follow-up of patients with cancer or liver <br>cirrhosis. Risk factors SVT may be associated with different underlying <br>disorders, either local or systemic. Abdominal cancer (mainly in the <br>pancreatic, hepatobiliary or gastrointestinal system) and <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> <br>are the most common risk factors for <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, being present in 31% and 34% of <br>patients in a recently published study.2 The most common local risk factors <br>for isolated MVT are cancer and abdominal inflammations or infections, each <br>being present in about 20% of cases.2 Isolated s<span style="color: red">PVT</span> was associated with <br>underlying acute pancreatitis in nearly half of the patients, followed by <br>cancer, cirrhosis and splenectomy.2 Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are <br>the leading systemic cause of SVT, diagnosed in 40% of BCS patients and <br>approximately 30% of patients with non-cirrhotic non-malignant <span style="color: red">PVT</span>.3 <br>Moreover, MPN subtypes showed different frequency according to the site of <br>thrombosis: polycythemia vera and myelofibrosis were more prevalent in BCS <br>than in <span style="color: red">PVT</span> patients; while no difference has been reported in the <br>prevalence of essential thrombocythemia and unclassifiable MPNs.3 Moreover, <br>the JAK2 V617F mutation, the main molecular marker of the <br>Philadelphia-negative MPN, emerged as an independent factor for SVT.4 Among <br>inherited thrombophilias, higher prevalence of prothrombin G20120A mutation <br>has been reported in patients with extra-hepatic <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, while Factor V Leiden <br>mutation was more frequent in BCS patients.1 Common systemic risk factors <br>for BCS are also hormonal stimuli, such as the use of oral contraceptives <br>and pregnancy or puerperium.1 Recently, an association between SVT and <br>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria has also been reported.1 Overall, <br>permanent or transient risk factors are identified in at least 80% of <br>patients, thus leaving a minority of events classified as unprovoked SVT.2 <br>Clinical presentation The clinical presentation of SVT is heterogeneous and <br>varies accord- ing to the characteristics of the onset and the involved <br>veins. Abdominal pain is the most frequent symptom, with a prevalence <br>ranging from 40% in patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> to more than 60% in patients with <br>MVT.2 Acute MVT is indeed associated with intestinal infarction in almost <br>onethird of patients.1Gastroesophageal varices and gastrointestinal <br>bleeding, triggered by portal hypertension, are reported in one-quarter of <br>patients, mainly with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> or S<span style="color: red">PVT</span>, and represent a challenge for treatment <br>decisions. 2 Chronic <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is also associated with the finding of portal <br>cavernoma, portal cholangiopathy and hepatic encephalopathy1. In the <br>majority of BCS patients, ascites, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and right <br>upper abdominal pain are reported.1 In a large cohort of 832 patients <br>diagnosed with SVT over a 20-year period, 18% were asymptomatic.2 <br>Antithrombotic treatment The choice of the optimal treatment in patients <br>with SVT is challenging. These patients have an increased risk of bleeding, <br>due to the presence of oesophageal varices or thrombocytopenia, but in the <br>meantime they also have a prothrombotic predisposition, resulting from the <br>underlying cirrhosis or malignancy. In literature, there is a lack of <br>randomized clinical trials to guide treatment decision, and contrasting <br>evidence emerged from observational studies in the last decades. The <br>majority of studies evaluated the antithrombotic treatment only in patients <br>with non-malignant non-cirrhotic <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. The retrospective study performed by <br>Condat et al.5 included 136 patients, with a median follow-up duration of 46 <br>months. Anticoagulant treatment with heparin or vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) <br>has been administered only in 84 patients, of whom 54 continued throughout <br>the follow-up period and 30 discontinued the treatment before, but its <br>duration was not reported. The anticoagulant treatment reduced the risk of <br>recurrent thrombotic events in the portal venous system by two thirds <br>(0.64/100 patient-years vs 1.87/100 patientyears, with and without <br>anticoagulant therapy, respectively), without increasing the risk or <br>severity of gastrointestinal bleeding. Indeed, the incidence of <br>gastrointestinal bleeding in the overall cohort was high (12.5/100 <br>patient-years) and the only independent predictor of bleeding was the <br>presence of moderate or large esophagogastric varices without adequate <br>prophylactic measures. Plessier et al.6 evaluated the early initiation of <br>heparin therapy, followed by oral <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, in 95 patients with acute <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span> enrolled in a prospective European study. The anticoagulant treatment <br>has been prescribed for at least 6 months, prolonged to long-term if <br>mesenteric vein thrombosis or permanent prothrombotic disorder, for a median <br>treatment duration of 234 days. At 1- year follow-up, recanalization was <br>detected in one-third of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> patients, and more than half of MVT and S<span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>patients. Although major bleeding occurred in 5% of patients, no death <br>resulted from haemorrhage. Opposite results emerged from the largest <br>unselected cohort of SVT patients, diagnosed and followed up at a single <br>institution, the Mayo Clinic, over a 20-year period.2 This retrospective <br>study enrolled 832 patients with thrombosis of different splanchnic veins <br>(including hepatic, splenic, portal or mesenteric) and different aetiologies <br>(particularly malignancy and cirrhosis). Warfarin has been provided to 235 <br>patients (28%), of whom 175 lifelong, but no information is available on the <br>use of alternative anticoagulant drugs such as heparins. After a mean follow <br>up of 27 months, the incidence of recurrent venous thrombosis was 3.5/100 <br>patient-years, but the recurrence-free survival was not improved by the <br>anticoagulant treatment (0.89 vs 0.77, p=0.38). The overall incidence of <br>major bleeding was 6.9/100 patient-years and these complications were <br>significantly higher in patients receiving warfarin compared with <br>not-anticoagulated patients (26.2% vs 18.9%, p<0.05). More recently, <br>Spaander et al.7 retrospectively collected information on 120 patients with <br>non-malignant non-cirrhotic <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Only 66 patients (55%) were anticoagulated, <br>with heparin or VKAs, for a median treatment duration of 1.9 years. The <br>anticoagulant therapy showed a tendency to prevent recurrent venous <br>thrombotic events (HR 0.2, p=0.1) but significantly increased the risk of <br>gastrointestinal bleeding (HR 2.0, p<0.01). Indeed, 58 bleeding episodes <br>happened in 66 patients on anticoagulant therapy vs 25 bleeding episodes in <br>54 patients without anticoagulant therapy. At multivariate analysis, <br>independent predictors of bleeding included also gastrointestinal bleeding <br>at baseline (HR 2.1, p<0.01) and ascites at baseline (HR 2.0, p=0.01). <br>Again, these findings are not generalizable to the whole population of SVT <br>patients, given the highly selected population included in this study. <br>Currently available guidelines recommend, in the absence of major <br>contraindications, to start the anticoagulant therapy in all patients <br>presenting with acute symptomatic SVT,8-9 with the aim to prevent the <br>intestinal infarction and the long-term complications of chronic portal <br>hypertension. After an initial period with either lowmolecular weight <br>heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin, most of the patients are <br>candidates to VKAs. However, LMWH should be considered for extended <br>treatment, if there is active malignancy, <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> or <br>thrombocytopenia.9 There is no consensus about the use of anticoagulant <br>drugs in chronic SVT, which presents with variceal bleeding and <br>hypersplenism but without signs of recent occlusion.8 Moreover, current <br>guidelines suggest not to treat patients with asymptomatic incidentally <br>detected SVT, even though the level of evidence is low.9 A recent <br>prospective international registry evaluated the use of antithrombotic <br>treatment for SVT patients in real life clinical practice.10 This unselected <br>cohort included 613 patients, with a non-negligible proportion of liver <br>cirrhosis or solid cancer (27.8% and 22.3%, respectively). The most commonly <br>site of thrombosis was <span style="color: red">PVT</span> (76.3%), with or without the involvement of other <br>venous segment, but there was also a minority of patients with isolated MVT <br>(10.9%), BCS (8.3%) or S<span style="color: red">PVT</span> (3.1%). During the acute phase, 136 patients <br>(22.2%) remained untreated. Factors associated with the decision not to <br>administer anticoagulant therapy were: incidental diagnosis, single vein <br>thrombosis, gastrointestinal bleeding at onset, solid cancer, liver <br>cirrhosis and thrombocytopenia. Excluding a minority of patients that <br>underwent interventional procedures, parenteral or oral <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> has <br>been administered to 470 patients (76.7%), of whom 295 continued with VKAs.<br><br>RECORD 364<br>Clinical features and natural history of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> after <br>radiofrequency ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma in Japan<br>Shimada T.

Date of Publication: <br>October 2013<br><br>Purpose: Little is known about <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) after <br>radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aimed <br>to determine the incidence, background, and natural history of RFA-related <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Methods: This is a retrospective study of 317 patients (219 males and <br>98 females) with HCC treated by RFA. Clinical data were compared between <br>patients with and without <span style="color: red">PVT</span> detected by ultrasound/CT. The median <br>follow-up period after RFA was 15.8 months. Results: <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was detected in 6 <br>(1.9 %) of 317 patients, 6 (0.8 %) of 802 treatments for HCC, and 6 (0.6 %) <br>of 964 sessions of RFA. Body mass index was significantly higher in patients <br>with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> (26.9 ± 3.1 kg/m(2)) than in those without (22.9 ± 3.5 kg/m(2), p = <br>0.0075). <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was significantly more frequent in RFA for the left lobe of the <br>liver (2.7 %) than for the other sites (0 %, p < 0.0001). Five of the six <br>patients received no treatment for <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, with natural outcomes of <br>disappearance in one patient, improvement in one patient, and unchanged <br>appearance in three patients. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was applied in the one <br>remaining patient and resulted in a successful recanalization. In the six <br>patients, there was no significant difference in hepatic functional reserve <br>between baseline and time of detection of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Conclusions: These results <br>indicated that a high body mass index and RFA for HCC in the left lobe might <br>be significant risk factors for <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and that RFA-related <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was rarely <br>progressive with little influence on liver function. © 2013 Asian Pacific <br>Association for the Study of the Liver.<br><br>RECORD 365<br>Portal and mesenteric vein thrombosis in inflammatory bowel disease outside <br>the surgical setting<br>Arora Z. Navaneethan U. Shen B.<br>American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013) 108 SUPPL. 1 (S526). Date of <br>Publication: October 2013<br><br>Purpose: Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) are at an increased <br>risk for <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) & mesenteric vein thrombosis (MVT). <br>Although <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and MVT commonly occur during or after restorative colectomy, <br>they can also occur during the course of medical management of IBD. The aim <br>of the study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics & clinical <br>outcomes of IBD patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span>/MVT without a history of recent abdominal <br>surgery. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed for all IBD <br>patients seen at the Cleveland Clinic who were also diagnosed with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> or <br>MVT. Patients with abdominal surgery within 6 months prior to diagnosis, <br>cirrhosis and malignancy were excluded. Comparison between groups was <br>performed with t-test for continuous variables or with Fisher's Exact tests <br>or Pearson's chi-square tests for categorical data. Results: Out of total 19 <br>patients, 10 were male and 9 female with a mean age of 45.3 ± 16 yrs and <br>mean duration of IBD of 14.6 ± 15.3 yrs. 15 patients had Crohn's Disease <br>while 4 had Ulcerative Colitis. Risk factors for thrombosis were present in <br>only 10 patients including 2 patients on oral contraceptive pills & 1 <br>patient with abnormal hypercoagulability testing. None of the patients had a <br>prior history of DVT/PE. Presenting symptoms were non-specific and included <br>abdominal pain, fever, diarrhea or nausea/vomiting and required <br>hospitalization in 13 patients. 12 patients (63.2%) had received steroids <br>and 10 patients (52.6%) had received biological agent in the last six months <br>prior to being diagnosed with <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Patients with involvement of the main <br>portal vein were more likely to be treated with <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, however <br>this trend did not reach statistical significance (p=0.06). Mean duration of <br>follow up was 26.3 ± 23.9 months. There was no significant difference in the <br>rate of resolution of thrombosis between the treated and non-treated <br>patients (p=0.19). In the 3 months following diagnosis of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, IBD <br>medications were escalated in 9 patients (47.4%) and 4 patients required <br>re-hospitalization including 3 for IBD related surgery. There was no <br>evidence of Esophageal/Gastric Varices in any of the 9 patients who <br>underwent EGD after being diagnosed with <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Conclusion: <span style="color: red">PVT</span> can be seen in <br>IBD patients outside the post-operative setting and can occur without the <br>presence of any other risk factors. Symptoms of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> are non-specific but <br>frequently severe enough to warrant hospitalization. Occurrence of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is <br>frequently associated with escalation of IBD therapy which may indicate <br>worsening disease course. Our findings also suggest that not all <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in IBD <br>patients need <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, especially if the clot is small, peripheral <br>or discovered incidentally on imaging and if the patient is asymptomatic. <br>(Table Presented).<br><br>RECORD 366<br>Pylephlebitis: An uncommon and dangerous cause of right upper quadrant pain<br>Ori T. Sherner J.<br>Chest (2013) 144:4 MEETING ABSTRACT. Date of Publication: October 2013<br><br>INTRODUCTION: Pylephlebitis, septic thrombophlebitis of the portal vein, is <br>an uncommon yet severe complication of bacteremia secondary to <br>intra-abdominal and pelvic infections. The non-specific presentation and low <br>incidence makes recognition challenging, yet relatively high morbidity and <br>mortality rates make diagnosis and treatment critical. CASE PRESENTATION: <br>Our patient is a 61 year old male with a history of diverticular bleed <br>presenting with a 10 day history of fever, nausea and vomiting. 4 days <br>earlier, he presented with similar symptoms and was diagnosed with suspected <br>viral gastroenteritis. The patient was unresponsive to symptomatic therapy <br>however, and he returned upon developing rigors and anorexia. At <br>presentation, the patient was febrile while all other vital signs were <br>normal. Laboratory evaluation revealed leukocytosis, elevated AST, ALT, and <br>alkaline phosphatase, and hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Blood cultures drawn <br>during the previous presentation confirmed Bacteroides fragilis bacteremia. <br>Abdominal computed tomography demonstrated heterogeneous hepatic parenchyma <br>and a left portal vein thrombus, confirmed on PET imaging. Antibiotic <br>therapy with pipercillin-tazobactam, and <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy with <br>intravenous heparin, was initiated. The patient remained intermittently <br>febrile with rigors for 72 hours before clinical improvement was evident. <br>After a two week hospitalization, during which the fever and abdominal <br>discomfort resolved, the patient was transitioned to oral therapies. He <br>completed 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy and 3 months of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>without evidence of recurrence. DISCUSSION: While pylephlebitis remains a <br>relatively uncommon diagnosis, early recognition in the critical care <br>setting is imperative to successful outcomes as clinical response to therapy <br>may take several days. Diverticulitis and appendicitis remain the most <br>commonly associated infections, though no etiology was identified here. <br>Fever and abdominal discomfort are hallmarks of the non-specific <br>presentation, and leukocytosis, transaminitis and elevated alkaline <br>phosphatase are routinely seen as in this case. Treatment consists of <br>prolonged parenteral antibiotics covering both gram negative enteric <br>organisms and anaerobes, and while there is no clear consensus regarding the <br>role of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, this patient was treated successfully. CONCLUSIONS: <br>We present a case of B. fragilis pylephlebitis, initially suspected to be <br>common gastroenteritis, treated successfully with targeted antibiotic <br>therapy and <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>.<br><br>RECORD 367<br>Management of portal hypertension in children with <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span><br>Giouleme O.

Predisposing conditions for <span style="color: red">PVT</span> are obscure in more than half of <br>the cases. Variceal bleeding and splenomegaly are the most frequent initial <br>manifestations. Radiologic imaging studies are the mainstay for diagnosis. <br>Treatment includes pharmacologic, endoscopic, and surgical modalities. <br>β-Adrenergic blockers are not routinely used in children because of unproven <br>efficacy and significant adverse effects. Endoscopic methods, such as <br>sclerotherapy and endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL), are highly effective <br>in the treatment of acute variceal bleeding and eradication of varices. EVL <br>is the treatment of choice because of minimal complications and the need for <br>few endoscopic sessions. EVL facilitates portal decompression either by the <br>formation of collateral vessels or by surgical portosystemic shunting, when <br>vessels grow to the proper diameter for anastomosis. Surgical portosystemic <br>shunts are reserved for refractory cases because of significant <br>complications and technical difficulties.

She has denied history of spontaneous abortions and <br>other health or family history was noncontributory. An exhaustive <br>differential diagnosis was performed. A CT scan of the abdomen was done, <br>revealing a cavernoma on the right branch of the portal vein resulting from <br>partial thrombosis.

Date of <br>Publication: October 2013<br><br>Objective: Endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration (EUSFNA) has <br>become an important procedure to acquire tissue diagnosis for pancreatic <br>tumour with low procedural complication. Uncommon reported complications of <br>EUS-FNA for pancreatic tumour were infection, bleeding, perforation, and <br>acute pancreatitis. Acute <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (A<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) as rare complication <br>of EUS-FNA was reported once only in a case of advance metastatic pancreatic <br>cancer. Local tumour infiltration of portal vein with post EUS-FNA <br>bacteremia was presumably the causative factors and intravenous antibiotic <br>prior to EUS-FNA was suggested as preventive measures. Methods: We present a <br>middle age lady with advance metastatic pancreatic cancer referred for <br>EUS-FNA. Preprocedural imaging studies showed a pancreatic head mass, <br>measuring 3.8 x 3.3 cm with thick enhancing wall and central hypodensity. <br>The portovenous and splenomesenteric vessels were patent. Several hepatic <br>masses were noted, in keeping with metastases. Antibiotic was given to the <br>patient in view of cystic nature of pancreatic tumour prior to EUS-FNA. The <br>EUS-FNA was performed with linear endoscopic ultrasound (Olympus, <br>GF-UCT140-AL5, Japan). EUS-FNA was performed on the lymph node initially, <br>and followed by pancreatic tumour with 22 G FNA needle (Cook Medical Inc, <br>Limerick Ireland). The pancareatic tumour was difficult to assess despite <br>changing to pancreatic tumour with 25 G FNA needle (Cook Medical Inc, <br>Limerick Ireland). The technical difficulty in assessing the lesion led to <br>prolonged procedural time. Results: She presented three days later with <br>abdominal pain, which later diagnosed as acute portovenous thrombosis based <br>on repeated computer tomogram. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was initiated and <br>subsequently patient was arranged for palliative chemotherapy.

Malek N. Plentz R.R.<br>United European Gastroenterology Journal (2013) 1:1 SUPPL. 1 (A154). Date of <br>Publication: October 2013<br><br>INTRODUCTION: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is caused by <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span>, <br>inflammatory diseases, cancer, myeloproliferative and coagulation disorders. <br>Acute <span style="color: red">PVT</span> can be distinguished from chronic <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Clinical presentation <br>depends on the onset and the extent of the thrombosis and the development of <br>collateral circulation / portal hypertension. For acute <span style="color: red">PVT</span> early initiation <br>of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> (AC) or thrombolytic therapy is recommended. The <br>therapeutic approach in chronic <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, especially in patients with liver <br>cirrhosis, is controversial. AIMS&METHODS: Our analysis was designed to <br>validate retrospectively the managment of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in patients with different <br>underlying illness. Therefore we reviewed all patients with diagnosed <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>(n=149) in a period of 2005 to 2012 at our Department of Medicine. Patient <br>characteristics, including demographics, acute or chronic <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, underlying <br>disease, therapeutic managment and complications were analyzed. RESULTS: <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>occurred in 102 men and 47 women. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was common in patients with <br>gastrointestinal cancer, <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span>, inflammatory diseases, abdominal <br>surgery, myeloproliferative and coagulation disorders. 76 patients had acute <br>and 73 chronic <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. 36 patients with acute <span style="color: red">PVT</span> were treated by AC. AC <br>(heparin, marcumar, thrombolytic therapy) could achieve in 20 patients <br>recanalisation. In 7 patients AC caused impairment and 9 patients died. 20 <br>patients with chronic <span style="color: red">PVT</span> were treated by AC. AC could achieve in 3 patients <br>recanalisation In 1 patient AC caused impairment, 16 patients showed no <br>change and 5 patients died. CONCLUSION: Patients with acute <span style="color: red">PVT</span> benefit <br>significantly from AC. AC is safe, especially in patients with liver <br>cirrhosis (CHILD A & B) and had no significant impact on side effects and <br>mortality.

Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2013<br><br>Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare, acquired haemolytic <br>anaemia caused by somatic mutation in phosphatidylinositol <br>glycan-complementation class A gene, resulting in absence of two key <br>complement regulatory proteins CD59 and CD55. Thrombosis occurs in up to 40% <br>of PNH patients; it commonly involves abdominal and cerebral veins and is <br>the leading cause of disease related death. We describe response to <br>Eculizumab (Soliris, Alexion) in a 28 year old male with PNH, Budd-Chiari <br>Syndrome, acute liver dysfunction, haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia. <br>The patient was admitted to the gastroenterology department with acute <br>abdominal pain, haemolitic anaemia, thrombocytopenia and transaminitis. <br>Abdominal doppler ultrasound (US) was immediately performed, detecting of <br>venous sovrahepatic thrombosis (Budd-Chiari Syndrome), portal vein <br>thrombosis, portal hypertension and ascites. He was started on low dose low <br>molecular weight heparin (platelets <40x109/L), but despite <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>progressive liver failure occurred, with poor pain control and worsening <br>ascites. We observed worsening thrombocytopenia and haemolysis, with lactate <br>dehydrogenase (LDH) reaching 1766 IU/L, unresponsive to steroids <br>administration. Bone marrow biopsy showed increased red cell turnover, and <br>peripheral blood flow cytometry characterized a large PNH clone (85% total <br>red blood cells). Liver biopsy revealed advanced stage idiopathic cirrhosis. <br>Eculizumab therapy was then started at the dose of 600 mg weekly for 4 weeks <br>and then 900 mg every 15 days. During the first month clinical conditions <br>improved and progressive reduction in abdominal pain was observed; <br>transaminases progressively normalized, LDH dropped to 518 IU/L and <br>platelets reached 40x109/L, allowing therapeutic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> with <br>warfarin. Recanalization of the <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> was found at the <br>Doppler US after 6 weeks' <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, but recanalization of <br>sovrahepatic veins was not achieved.

No further thrombotic episode has occurred. This case shows that <br>Eculizumab can block intravascular haemolysis and platelet consumption and <br>can improve hepatic failure, allowing full dose of anticoagulants as therapy <br>for current thrombosis or as prophylaxis for future events.<br><br>RECORD 372<br>Successful liver transplantation in a patient with splanchnic vein <br>thrombosis and pulmonary embolism due to polycythemia vera with Jak2v617f <br>mutation and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia<br>Biagioni E.

Wilford R.<br>American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013) 108 SUPPL. 1 (S335). Date of <br>Publication: October 2013<br><br>Introduction: Clinicians have become increasingly reliant on imaging studies <br>to make diagnoses. Despite improved sensitivity of these imaging modalities, <br>some diagnoses cannot be made without biopsy. We present a case of <br>pylephlebitis, in which the radiographic evidence pointed overwhelmingly to <br>metastatic disease. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of <br>pylephlebitis mimicking colon cancer with liver metastases. Case: A <br>65-year-old female with a history of hypertension and hypothyroidism <br>presented with six weeks of fatigue, weight loss, fever, and jaundice. She <br>had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy three years ago for cholelithiasis. <br>Initial workup revealed leukocytosis with bandemia (WBC 20,200, 17% bands), <br>elevated bilirubin (7.4 mg/dl), and liver enzymes with an obstructive <br>pattern (alkaline phosphatase 503 U/L, AST 82 U/L, ALT 96 U/L). Blood and <br>urine cultures were obtained, and ertapenem was begun empirically. Abdominal <br>CT with oral and intravenous contrast showed <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>, <br>multiple liver lesions consistent with metastases, and an ascending colon <br>stricture, leading to extensive oncologic and gastroenterological <br>evaluation. No intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilation or stricture <br>was seen on MRCP, but it showed numerous hepatic masses, concerning for <br>metastases. Liver biopsy showed biliary obstruction, but no neoplasm. She <br>remained febrile, despite negative blood and urine cultures. After expanding <br>antibiotic coverage to piperacillin/tazobactam and azithromycin, she <br>improved clinically, and her bilirubin and transaminases decreased. <br>Colonoscopy showed diverticulosis without masses or strictures. She was <br>diagnosed with pylephlebitis and discharged home on amoxicillin/clavulanate <br>and <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. One month later, she was asymptomatic, her jaundice had <br>resolved, and repeat abdominal CT showed a patent portal vein and complete <br>resolution of the hepatic lesions. Conclusion: Pylephlebitis is a rare <br>disorder that carries a high morbidity and mortality, despite early <br>detection with CT imaging and broad spectrum antibiotics. Greater than 80% <br>of documented cases contain an identifiable infectious or inflammatory <br>etiology. Our patient lacked demonstrable intra-abdominal, urinary, and <br>blood-borne infection, but rather had radiographic findings that strongly <br>suggested colon cancer with liver metastases. Multiple lesions in the liver <br>are often malignant, but clinicians should keep their differentials open to <br>other etiologies. Pylephlebitis should be considered in a patient with <br>fever, abnormal liver function tests, and <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>.<br><br>RECORD 374<br>Incidence of thrombotic events in chronic liver disease<br>Mocanu I. Amaral M.S. Alves J.D.<br>European Journal of Internal Medicine (2013) 24 SUPPL. 1 (e89). Date of <br>Publication: October 2013<br><br>Introduction: Chronic liver disease is labeled as a classic acquired <br>bleeding disorder, however it has been demonstrated that these patients <br>present thrombin production within normal range, which raises questions <br>about the International Normalized Ration included in several prognosis <br>stratification scores. Although this population does not seem to be <br>protected from thrombotic events, the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis is <br>mostly withheld from patients with chronic liver disease. Objectives: Our <br>aim is to analyze the incidence of thrombotic events and the percentage of <br>prophylaxis use in in-patients with diagnosis chronic liver disease. <br>Methods: Retrospective study from clinical data-base of patients with <br>diagnosis of chronic liver disease and thromboembolism at discharge during <br>one year. We also evaluated the use of thromboprophylaxis, mortality, <br>admission time, and Child-Pugh score, among other variables. Results: 34 <br>hospitalizations, 67% male with a mean age of 59 years and mean value of <br>stay of 16 days. 23% of these were given prophylactic anticoagulants. We <br>identified two cases of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> one of which received oral <br>anticoagulant at discharge. There was no evidence of hemorrhagic <br>complications in patients medicated with anticoagulants. Conclusion: The <br>need for considering <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in patients with chronic liver disease <br>is an emerging issue due to the increase in life expectancy of these <br>patients with underlying co-morbidities that boost the risk of thrombotic <br>events. Although our study has limitations, as the short period of time is <br>included, we considered that there is a need of a larger study to identify <br>the true incidence of thrombotic events in this population.<br><br>RECORD 375<br>A case report of a patient with recurrent pouchitis and large pulmonary <br>emboli<br>Yoo L. Elwir S. Tinsley A. Williams E.<br>American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013) 108 SUPPL. 1 (S421). Date of <br>Publication: October 2013<br><br>Purpose: We report a case of a 33-year-old woman with a history of <br>ulcerative colitis diagnosed 10 years prior to presentation status post <br>total abdominal colectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) 6 years <br>prior to presentation. The patient suffered recurrent severe antibiotic <br>resistant pouchitis shortly after her surgery. Two years ago, a pouchoscopy <br>demonstrated continued pouchitis with more extensive inflammation above the <br>pouch. The patient was started on Azathioprine and responded to a course of <br>steroids and antibiotics. After her endoscopic evaluation, the developed an <br>idiopathic left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis at her IV site and <br>completed 6 months of warfarin therapy. One month prior to presentation, the <br>patient had another episode of severe pouchitis and was treated with <br>antibiotics and a steroid taper. During her taper, the patient presented <br>with dyspnea on exertion. Chest CT scan revealed large bilateral pulmonary <br>emboli (PE) with severe right heart strain, enlargement of the right atrium <br>and main pulmonary artery consistent with pulmonary hypertension. She was <br>treated with enoxaparin and warfarin and discharged home. Our patient <br>appeared to have developed thromboemboli in the setting of two episodes of <br>pouchitis. Hospitalized inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients are known <br>to be at increased risk for thromboembolism. The most frequent complication <br>in ulcerative colitis patients after ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) is <br>pouchitis, a nonspecific inflammation of the ileal pouch reservoir, having a <br>cumulative prevalence of 50%. It is unknown if this inflammatory state <br>increases hypercoagulability. While portal vein thrombi (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) have recently <br>been linked to IPAA and patients found with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> had a higher incidence of <br>postoperative pouchitis, an association with PE has not been described. <br>Hospitalized patients with IBD and pouchitis, such as our patient, must be <br>considered at high risk for thromboembolism and receive appropriate <br>prophylaxis or be considered for long-term <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> regardless of <br>history of thromboembolism.<br><br>RECORD 376<br>Budd Chiari Syndrome (BCS): The Austin experience<br>French J. Mo A. Testro A. Gow P. Grigg A.<br>Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2013) 28 SUPPL. 2 (62). Date of <br>Publication: October 2013<br><br>Aim: Budd Chiari Syndrome 'BCS' is a rare disorder, with an annual incidence <br>of 0.2-0.8 per million.1 The few available studies report liver <br>transplantation rates of 12.7%2 to 42%3 and poor 5-year transplantationfree <br>survival of 28%3 for primary BCS. We aimed to investigate the epidemiology, <br>natural history and outcomes of BCS patients at Austin Health. Method: This <br>study was retrospective and was performed at the Austin Hospital. We <br>searched the hospitals computerised diagnosis database and the hospital's <br>liver transplant database for cases of Budd Chiari syndrome from January <br>2000 until August 2012. Patients with hepatic venous outflow obstruction at <br>any point from the small hepatic veins to the inferior vena cava were <br>included. Patients with secondary Budd Chiari syndrome were excluded. <br>Results: Median age at diagnosis was 42 years (range 21-76). 59% were <br>female. Eight patients (30%) had concomitant <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>). <br>Twenty four patients (89%) had at least one identifiable risk factor. The <br>most common risk factor was myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN, n = 16) with <br>polycythaemia rubra vera (PRV) being the most common subtype. JAK-2 was <br>positive in 12 of 18 patients tested. The primary intervention was <br>transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS) in thirteen patients <br>(48%) and angioplasty/stenting in eleven (41%). One patient had a <br>splenorenal shunt. No patients required transplantation during the 10 year <br>follow up period. At median follow-up of 5 years 16 patients had compensated <br>liver disease, 3 had decompensated liver disease, 2 patients died a liver <br>related death (one from hepatorenal syndrome and bilateral pulmonary emboli, <br>one death secondary to hepatic encephalopathy) , 4 died from a non liver <br>related death and 2 patients were lost to follow-up. The overall transplant <br>free one year survival was 96% and 81% at five years. Discussion: In this <br>retrospective study, we aimed to characterise the aetiology and treatment <br>outcomes of patients with Budd Chiari syndrome treated in our institution. <br>This is the only published cohort of Budd Chiari patients where no liver <br>transplantations were required. We postulate that this is due to intensive <br>TIPS surveillance at our hospital to prevent TIPS failure. MPN is the most <br>common aetiological factor in BCS. This can be missed at diagnosis, and all <br>patients should have JAK2 testing or bone marrow biopsy. TIPS or <br>angioplasty/stenting, together with <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> and treatment of any <br>MPN, results in favourable long term transplantation-free outcomes and <br>represents optimal standard of care.<br><br>RECORD 377<br>Complete <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in a patient with active crohn's disease<br>Cornish C.

Date of <br>Publication: October 2013<br><br>Introduction: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> is an uncommon occurrence in patients <br>with inflammatory bowel disease, but when it does occur it is usually soon <br>after intra-abdominal surgery. We describe a case of complete portal vein <br>thrombosis in a patient with active Crohn's disease. Case Summary: A <br>41-year-old man with a 10-year history of Crohn's colitis, treated with <br>sulfasalazine 1,500 mg BID and mercaptopurine 75 mg daily, presented to the <br>office with a 3-week history of generalized, constant abdominal pain, with <br>associated anorexia and 10-12 loose, bloody bowel movements per day, which <br>began localizing to the right upper quadrant (RUQ) 4 days prior to being <br>seen. His physical exam was notable for RUQ tenderness to even light <br>palpation with guarding and mild hepatomegaly. His labs were significant for <br>AST 209 U/L, ALT 693 U/L, and CRP 62 mg/L. His initial abdominal ultrasound, <br>obtained 1 week after his clinic visit, demonstrated a non-occlusive left <br>portal vein thrombus extending into the bifurcation of the main portal vein. <br>The right and main portal vein were both patent. His abdominal pain <br>gradually resolved and his liver profile returned to normal. Five weeks <br>later, he presented to the emergency department with intense RUQ abdominal <br>pain. His AST, ALT, and total bilirubin were found to be 1,406 U/L, 2,527 <br>U/L, and 1.7 mg/dL (direct 0.9 mg/dL), respectively. An abdominal ultrasound <br>was obtained, which demonstrated partial thrombosis of the right portal vein <br>and complete thrombosis of the main portal vein. He was subsequently started <br>on a heparin drip after labs to check for a hypercoagulable state, which <br>were unremarkable, had been drawn. Two days later, the patient was started <br>on warfarin, as well as an enoxaparin bridge, and discharged to home. The <br>patient's liver profile quickly improved. A repeat abdominal ultrasound <br>after 6 months of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy has not yet been performed. <br>Discussion: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> is a potentially life-threatening <br>hepatobiliary manifestation associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) <br>and occurs more often in patients with Crohn's disease than ulcerative <br>colitis. The formation of a portal vein thrombus in patients with IBD is <br>rare, especially in those who have not recently undergone intra-abdominal <br>surgery. Given that the patient presented with <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in the <br>setting of a Crohn's disease flare, we hypothesize that ulceration of the <br>bowel mucosa allowed for translocation of bacteria into the portal venous <br>system leading to portal pyelophlebitis followed by <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>.<br><br>RECORD 378<br>Risk factors of arterial or venous thromboembolism in cirrhotic patients<br>Laabidi A.

Date of <br>Publication: October 2013<br><br>INTRODUCTION: Cirrhosis results in a complex pattern of defects in <br>haemostatic functions with reduced synthesis of pro and anticoagulant <br>factors. As possible complication of coagulation disorders in cirrhosis, <br>could be the development of arterial or venous thromboembolism (AVTE). The <br>purpose of our study was to determine thrombotic risk factors in cirrhotic <br>patients. AIMS&METHODS: Cirrhotic patients were enrolled. The presence of <br>personal and familial history of AVTE was investigated. Patients were <br>divided into 2 groups. Group1 included patients who developed arterial or <br>venous thromboembolism after cirrhosis diagnosis and group 2 cirrhotic <br>patients without thrombotic event. White blood cells, platelet count, <br>prothrombine time, INR, albumin, urea, pro coagulant factors (VIII, XII, <br>VII, II, V) were determined. Level of antithrombin, protein C and protein S <br>were measured. Search for factor V Leiden and prothrombin gene mutation <br>(G20210A) were performed with PCRRFLP. Anticardiolipin and <br>antiB2glycoprotein antibodies were also investigated. Both groups of <br>patients were compared with regard of clinical and biological findings. <br>RESULTS: Fifty one cirrhotic patients were included. Their mean age was 56.8 <br>years. They were men and women. Among the 51 cirrhotic patients, 7 (13.7%) <br>had experienced AVTE after cirrhosis diagnosis: deep venous thrombosis <br>(n=2), pulmonary embolism (n=1), Budd Chiari syndrome (n=1), portal <br>thrombosis (n=3). They were compared to 46 cirrhotic patients without <br>thrombosis. No patient with AVTE had neither personal nor familial history <br>of thrombosis. In an univariate analysis, white blood cell count and <br>platelet count were significantly higher in patients with AVTE than other <br>cirrhotic patients (respectively 8795 vs 5032/mm(3), p < 0.018 and 91133 vs <br>154375/mm(3), p=0.03) However, In a multivariate analysis only the platelet <br>count was independently predictive of VTE in cirrhotic patients (P=0.05). <br>Moreover, prothrombin time, INR, albumin, urea, level of pro and <br>anticoagulant factors were not statistically different in both groups. There <br>was no link between the presence of Factor VLeiden, prothrombin gene <br>mutation (G20210A), anticardiolipin and antiB2glycoprotein antibodies to <br>thrombosis. CONCLUSION: Approximately 13.7% of cirrhotic patients resulted <br>in a thromboembolic event. Platelet count was predictive of increased risk <br>of AVTE as it was supported by other studies.

Date of Publication: 27 Sep 2013<br><br>Background: We describe ITA in patients with T1D using two novel <br>immunosuppressive regimens based on the anti-LFA 1 antibody, efalizumab, or <br>the costimulation blocking antibody, belatacept, that permit long-term islet <br>allograft survival without need for corticosteroids or calcineurin <br>inhibitors (CNI). We also asked whether ITA using these protocols could <br>achieve outcomes comparable to PTA performed at our institution. Methods: <br>Ten T1D patients received ITA between 2007-2010. Insulin independence, renal <br>function & adverse reactions were compared to 17 TID who received <br>consecutive PTA between 2002-2011. All patients received thymoglobulin <br>induction. Maintenance immunosuppression for ITA consisted of Efalizumab <br>(n=5) or Belatacept (n=5), sirolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). PTA <br>patients received low-dose tacrolimus, MMF, sirolimus and prednisone. High <br>insulin requirements and BMI > 30 were exclusion criteria for the ITA; and <br>high cardiovascular risk is an exclusion criterion for PTA. Results: Six <br>patients received one and four received two islet transplants. All 10 became <br>insulin independent after the final transplant for amean of 46months <br>(25-64). Seven (70%) remain insulin independent at most recent follow-up <br>(3.1 - 5.8yrs), and 3 resumed insulin use at 24, 34, 34 months (see Table <br>1). Mean duration of insulin independence in the 17 PTA recipients was 72.8 <br>months (12-136). Thus after final transplant, all ITA (100%) were insulin <br>independent at 1 year and 7/10 (70%) at 3 years. For PTA, 16/17 (94%) were <br>insulin independent at 1 year and 13/17 (76.5%) at 3 years. Significant <br>complications in the ITA group included 1 partial <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> <br>which resolved with <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, and 1 case of posttransplant <br>lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) which resolved with therapy and did not <br>result in graft loss. In the PTA group, there was 1 case of PTLD <br>necessitating withdrawal of immunosuppression; 4 graft pancreatectomies for <br>pancreatitis/rejection; 1 bowel obstruction; 3 incisional hernias; 1 soft <br>tissue infection; and 2 conversions to enteric drainage. Renal function <br>remained stable in 10/10 ITA and decreased in 5/17 PTA patients on CNI based <br>regimens. Conclusions: Long term insulin independence following ITA <br>performed in selected patients receiving co-stimulation/adhesion blockade is <br>similar to that observed for PTA at our institution. Although selection <br>criteria for ITA versus PTA are different, these data demonstrate increasing <br>options to achieve long term insulin-free survival for people undergoing <br>beta cell replacement for T1D.

Date of <br>Publication: September 2013<br><br>The human hemostasis system is complex and poorly understood after decades <br>of intense scientific study. Despite multiple defects in routine coagulation <br>laboratory studies in patients with chronic liver disease, there is growing <br>evidence that these patients are effectively "rebalanced" with regard to <br>procoagulant and anticoagulant activity and that most of these patients <br>remain in a tenuous but balanced state of hemostasis. A major difficulty in <br>the assessment of these patients is that there are no established laboratory <br>tests that accurately reflect the changes in both the procoagulant and <br>anticoagulant systems; therefore, routine laboratory testing is misleading <br>to the clinician and may prompt inappropriate or risky therapies with little <br>real benefit to the patient. The international normalized ratio is an <br>example of this type of misleading test. Although the international <br>normalized ratio is inextricably linked to prognosis and severity of protein <br>synthetic dysfunction in acute and chronic liver disease, it is a very poor <br>marker for bleeding risk and should not be used in isolation for this <br>purpose.

Ultrasonography (every 3 months) and computed <br>tomography (every 6 months) were performed to check the portal vein axis. <br>The primary outcome was prevention of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Radiologists and hepatologists <br>that assessed outcomes were blinded to group assignments. Analysis was by <br>intention to treat.

The <br>actuarial probability of liver decompensation was lower in the enoxaparin <br>group (P 5 0.0001). Eight patients in the enoxaparin group and 13 controls <br>died. The actuarial probability of survival was higher in the enoxaparin <br>group (P 5 0.020). No relevant side effects or hemorrhagic events were <br>reported.

Borja A.M. Xing W. Lymen E. Azucena B. Chin T.J.<br>Annals of the Academy of Medicine Singapore (2013) 42:8 SUPPL. 1 (S11). Date <br>of Publication: August 2013<br><br>Introduction: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is thrombosis that develops in <br>the trunk of the portal vein which can extend to its branches. It results <br>from a combination of local and systemic prothrombotic factors. Methods: We <br>describe 2 cases for this study. Patient 1 is a 77-year-old male who was <br>admitted for cholangitis and pancreatitis and was found to have an <br>incidental <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Patient 1's investigations and laboratory workup: total <br>white count 23.0x109/L (neutrophils 91.6%), haemoglobin 11.7g/dL, platelets <br>147x109/L; total bilirubin 184umol/L, alanine transaminase 111U/L, aspartate <br>transaminase 113 U/L, gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase 515 U/L; amylase 641 U/L; <br>hepatitis screening was negative. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan <br>showed cholangitis with common bile duct calculi and an incidental <br>thrombosis of the segmental branches of the right portal vein. Thrombophilia <br>screen was negative. Patient 2 is a 60-year-old female with child's B <br>cryptogenic <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> and was admitted for gastroenteritis and left <br>breast lump. She was found to have an incidental non-occlusive thrombus in <br>the main portal vein. Her investigations and laboratory workup were as <br>follows: total white cell 6.2x109/L (neutrophils 73.1%), haemoglobin <br>9.1g/dL, platelets 116x109/L; Na 133 mmol/L, K 4.6 mmol/L, creatinine 115 <br>umol/L; albumin 29g/L, total bilirubin 25 umol/L, alanine transaminase <br>27U/L, aspartate transaminase 42 U/L, C-reactive protein 15.5mg/L. CT scan <br>showed left breast mass, cirrhosis with portal hypertension and <br>non-occlusive portal vein thrombus. Results: Patient 1 underwent endoscopic <br>retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), removal of stones and was given <br>antibiotics. Patient was not anticoagulated due to the ongoing infection. A <br>repeat CT scan 6 months later showed no evidence of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Patient 2 underwent <br>peritoneal drainage and was given antibiotics. No <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was given <br>due to low platelet count. Eleven months later, an ultrasound Doppler of the <br>hepatobiliary system revealed no evidence of vascular thrombosis. The left <br>breast mass was later noted to be an invasive adenocarcinoma. Conclusion: <br>The decision to anticoagulate a patient with <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> depends <br>on several factors. Spontaneous resolution is possible but is an uncommon <br>occurrence.<br><br>RECORD 384<br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in neonates: Results of an <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> protocol<br>Williams S. Brandao L.R. Labarque V. Williams S.<br>Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013) 11 SUPPL. 2 (389). Date of <br>Publication: July 2013<br><br>Background: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is a common thrombotic event in <br>neonates. The majority of patients will have resolution of thrombus with a <br>minority going on to develop complications such as portal hypertension. Due <br>to the scarcity of published studies, the role of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> (ACT) in <br>neonatal <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is unclear. Aims: The aim was to describe the treatment and <br>outcomes following <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in a neonatal cohort treated <br>according to an institutional <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> protocol. Methods: The study <br>was approved by the hospital research ethics board and written consent <br>waived. A retrospective chart review of neonates presenting with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> to the <br>Hospital for Sick Children from January 2008 to September 2010, identified <br>from the clinical thrombosis database, was conducted. All patients were < 30 <br>days at the time of diagnosis and treated according to the institutional <br>protocol for <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> for neonatal <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. In the <br>protocol, neonates with non-occlusive <span style="color: red">PVT</span> are not treated with ACT unless <br>thrombotic extension occurs or there is a concomitant other indication for <br>ACT, and neonates with occlusive <span style="color: red">PVT</span> without contraindication to ACT are <br>treated. Clinical and radiologic data were collected. Poor outcome was <br>defined as portal hypertension, hypersplenism, liver atrophy on follow-up. <br>Descriptive statistics and Fisher exact testing were completed to compare <br>the neonates by presenting features, treatment and outcome. Results: There <br>were 94 patients identified. The mean age (± SD) was 10 days (± 5). The mean <br>gestational age was 35 weeks (± 5). Fiftythree (56%) patients received ACT <br>and 41 (44%) patients did not receive ACT. Of the patients treated with ACT <br>6/53 (11%) received standard heparin, 34/53 (64%) received low molecular <br>weight heparin and 13/53 (25%) received both standard and low molecular <br>weight heparin. Follow-up occurred for a mean of 344 days (± 315). ACT was <br>continued for a mean 41 days (± 55). Complete resolution of thrombus <br>occurred in 48/94 (51%), partial resolution in 15/94 (16%) and progression <br>in 25/94 (27%). Progression of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was associated with initial non-occlusive <br>thrombus occurring in 15/36 (42%) of patients with non-occlusive thrombus <br>vs. 9/57 (16%) of patients with initial occlusive thrombosis (P = 0.008). <br>Thrombosis involving the inferior vena cava (IVC) was associated with <br>thrombotic progression occurring in 8/12 (67%) of patients with IVC <br>involvement compared to 16/83 (67%) of patients without IVC involvement (P = <br>0.001). There was no association of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> with thrombus resolution <br>or decreased rates of poor outcome. Liver atrophy occurred in 25/94 (27%). <br>Portal hypertension or hypersplenism occurred in 6/94 (6%) patients. Major <br>bleeds occurred in 7/53 (13%) of patients who received ACT. Conclusions: The <br>majority of neonates had a good outcome, and <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was not <br>associated with decreased rates of poor outcome in this cohort of patients <br>treated according to an institutional protocol for neonatal <span style="color: red">PVT</span>.

Date of <br>Publication: July 2013<br><br>Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms are considered to be <br>acquired thrombophilic states. Thromboses, both arterial and venous (not <br>rarely in unusual sites), are often the initial events leading to the <br>diagnosis. After diagnosis, the yearly incidence of thrombotic events is <br>highly variable, and ranges from approximately 1% to 10%. The identification <br>of patients at risk who may benefit from antithrombotic therapy remains a <br>challenge, and it is currently based on age and history of thrombotic <br>events. However, the predictive value of these clinical characteristics is <br>rather limited. Few prospective studies and even fewer interventional <br>randomized studies are available, and there are no studies designed to <br>formally validate the use of risk stratification. The implementation of <br>laboratory parameters such as leukocytosis and/or the JAK2 V617F mutation <br>into a scoring system may be of interest. The mechanisms at work leading to <br>thrombosis remain largely speculative, but are likely to be complex and <br>multifactorial, with a prominent role of cell-cell interactions, mostly <br>owing to qualitative changes. The long-term treatment options to prevent <br>thrombosis are, schematically, aspirin alone as primary prevention for the <br>low-risk patients, and cytoreduction combined with aspirin for the other <br>patients. In very low-risk young essential thrombocythemia patients, <br>abstention can even be considered. The optimal duration of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>after a thrombotic event is not established. All antithrombotic therapies <br>should be balanced with the hemorrhagic risk, which can also be increased in <br>these patients. © 2013 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.<br><br>RECORD 386<br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in children and adolescents<br>Williams S.

Methods: The study was approved <br>by the hospital research ethics board and written consent waived. A <br>retrospective chart review of infants and children with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> presenting to <br>the Hospital for Sick Children from January 2008 to January 2012, identified <br>from the clinical thrombosis database was conducted. Neonates were excluded, <br>and age was limited to 31 days to 18 years at time of presentation. Clinical <br>and radiologic data were collected. Descriptive statistics and Fisher exact <br>testing were completed to compare the two groups; infants (age ≤1 year) and <br>children (age. >1 year). Results: 36 children with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> were identified. At <br>the time of presentation, 14/36 patients (38%) had underlying liver disease <br>(biliary atresia (n = 6), sclerosing cholangitis (n = 3), metabolic disease <br>(n = 1), chemotherapy induced liver disease (n = 2), hepatic infiltration (n <br>= 2). The majority of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>s, 19/36 (52%), were identified incidentally, on <br>abdominal ultrasound completed during work up for other medical illness; <br>(fever and sepsis (n = 7), pre- or post- liver transplant (n = 5), elevated <br>liver enzymes (n = 2), pre Kasai (n = 1), abdominal pain (n = 10). Risk <br>factors (intra-abdominal infection, sepsis or abdominal surgery) were <br>present in 25/36 (70%). Infants (n = 20) had a mean age (±SD) of 5 months <br>(±3), children (n = 16) had a mean age of 10 years (±5). Mean follow-up in <br>infants was 24 months (±24) and in children was 36 months (±37). There was a <br>history of a prior umbilical venous catheter in 10/20 (50%) infants and 1/16 <br>(6%) children (P = 0.0091). Cavernous transformation was found on initial <br>imaging in 2/20 (10%) infants and 7/16 (44%) children (P = 0.049). <br>Gastrointestinal bleeding at time of initial presentation was present in <br>0/20 infants and in 5/16 (31%) children (P = 0.012). There was no difference <br>between infants and children in hypersplenism (19%) gastrointestinal <br>bleeding in follow- up (11%), PH at time of presentation (20%), PH in <br>follow-up (31%), thrombus resolution (58%), need for portosystemic shunting <br>(8%), growth failure (20%) or thrombophilia [low protein C, protein S, <br>antithrombin] (44%).

Conclusions: In this <br>single institution cohort, limited by the small number of patients, rates of <br>portal hypertension and gastrointestinal bleeding were similar in infants <br>and children, but higher than reported rates in neonates. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in infants had <br>a greater association with previous umbilical catheter, and presented less <br>often with cavernous transformation or gastrointestinal bleeding than in <br>children.<br><br>RECORD 387<br>Thrombotic risk factors in cirrhotic patients<br>Baccouche H. Labidi A. Kaabi H. Mahjoub S. Hsouna K. Fekih M. Slama H. <br>Filali A. Ben Romdhane N.<br>Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013) 11 SUPPL. 2 (1170-1171). Date <br>of Publication: July 2013<br><br>Background: Cirrhosis results in a complex pattern of defects in haemostatic <br>functions with reduced synthesis of pro and anticoagulant factors. As <br>possible complication of coagulation disorders in cirrhosis, could be the <br>development of arterial and venous thromboembolism (AVTE). The purpose of <br>our study was to determine thrombotic risk factors in cirrhotic patients. <br>Methods: Fifty one cirrhotic patients were enrolled into a case control <br>study. The presence of personal and familial history of AVTE were <br>investigated. White blood cells, platelet count, prothrombine time, INR, <br>albumin, urea, procoagulant factors (VIII, XII, VII, II, V) were determined. <br>Level of antithrombin, protein C and protein S were measured (respectively <br>STACHROM AT, STACLOT PC, STACLOT PS; DIAGNOSTICA STAGO). Search for factor V <br>Leiden and prothrombin gene mutation (G20210A) were performed with PCR-RFLP. <br>Anticardioloipin and antiB2glycoprotein antibodies were also investigated. <br>Results: Mean age was 56.8 years old (range16-86 years old). Sex ratio was <br>0.9. Among the 51 cirrhotic patients, 7 patients (13.7%) had experienced <br>AVTE after cirrhosis diagnosis: deep venous thrombosis (n = 2), pulmonary <br>embolism (n = 1), Budd Chiari syndrome (n = 1), portal thrombosis (n = 3). <br>They were compared to 46 cirrhotic patients without thrombosis. No patient <br>with AVTE had neither personal nor familial history of thrombosis. In an <br>univariate analysis, white blood cell count and platelet count were <br>significantly higher in patients with AVTE than other cirrhotic patients <br>(respectively, 8795 vs. 5032/mm(3), P < 0.018 and 91133 vs. 154375/mm(3), P <br>= 0.03) However, In a multivariate analysis only the platelet count was <br>independently predictive of AVTE in cirrhotic patients (P = 0.05). White <br>blood count was not an independent predictive factor of thrombosis in <br>cirrhotic patients (P = 0.07). Moreover, prothrombin time, INR, albumin, <br>urea, level of pro and anticoagulant factors were not statistically <br>different in both groups. There was no link between the presence of Factor V <br>Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation (G20210A), anticardiolipin and <br>antiB2glycoprotein antibodies to thrombosis. Conclusions: Approximately <br>13.7% of cirrhotic patients resulted in a thromboembolic event. Platelet <br>count was predictive of increased risk of AVTE as it was supported by other <br>studies.

Alweis R.<br>Journal of General Internal Medicine (2013) 28 SUPPL. 1 (S345-S346). Date of <br>Publication: June 2013<br><br>LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1: Recognize the clinical features and diagnosis of <br>Intrahepatic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. LEARNING OBJECTIVE 2: Describe the <br>treatment and prognosis of Intrahepatic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. CASE: Portal <br>Vein thrombosis is frequently being diagnosed these days, with life time <br>risk of 1 % in the general population. Intrahepatic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>, <br>however, is a less common entity than extrahepatic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. <br>Usually, intrahepatic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> is associated with <br>hepatocellular carcinoma. In adults, approximately 25 % of patients with <br>extrahepatic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> have underlying cirrhosis that might <br>extend into intrahepatic portal veins. Other common causes of intrahepatic <br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> include prothrombotic disorder and abdominal <br>inflammation. It might be complicated with splenomegaly, esophageal or <br>gastric varices, portal hypertensive gastropathy or ascites. A 38-year-old <br>morbidly obese female, with recent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for <br>weight control presented in the emergency department with severe abdominal <br>pain for 2 days. Initially, the pain was crampy in nature and associated <br>with burning sensations in the epigastric area. It was also associated with <br>nausea and vomiting. She was passing flatus with normal bowel movements. <br>There was no history of melena, hematochezia, hematemesis or dysuria. She <br>denied fever, chills, chest pain and shortness of breath. In the meantime, <br>she was being treated for left lower lobe pneumonia. Physical exam revealed <br>mild tenderness in the mid-epigastric area but no obvious <br>hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory investigations revealed hemoglobin 12.1 <br>gm/dL, WBC 7800/μL, platelets 232000/μL and normal abdominal X-ray and serum <br>electrolytes. D-Dimer was elevated at 1000 mg/dL. Abdominal CTscan showed <br>intrahepatic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in the left lobe of the liver. Protein <br>C, protein S, antithrombin III were all normal and factor V Leiden, <br>anti-cardiolipin antibodies and lupus anticoagulant antibodies were found to <br>be negative. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> with heparin and warfarin was initiated and she <br>was discharged on warfarin for 6 months. On follow up exam after 6 months, <br>she was asymptomatic without any evidence of thrombosis on the abdominal CT <br>scan. DISCUSSION: The patient presented with several risk factors, including <br>recent surgery. Some studies suggest the possibility that the CO2 used for <br>pneumoperitoneum may increase risk, but tissue damage from the surgery <br>itself is a well-recognized risk factor for thrombophilia. Tissue damage <br>from gastric surgery may lead to release of procoagulant products in the <br>portal venous system eliciting <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. Additionally, <br>infection like pneumonia and obesity itself are risk factors for thrombosis. <br>Since her pneumonia was almost resolved with treatment, negative <br>prothrombotic work-up, recent surgery was the most likely explanation of her <br>condition. Treatment consists of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> for at least 6 months. It <br>is prudent to repeat the abdominal CT scan after 6 months to confirm the <br>resolution of thrombus. It is unclear whether a follow-up D-dimer is useful <br>in the decision to discontinue <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. Despite this increasingly <br>common condition, there remains a paucity of studies to guide clinicians.<br><br>RECORD 390<br>Management dilemma: Progressive thrombosis in a patient with sarcoidosis, <br>cirrhosis and a history of bleeding esophageal varices<br>Pan L.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE 2: Understand the <br>risks and benefits of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> vs. conservative management in <br>patients with chronic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> secondary to <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span>. <br>CASE: A 60 year old female with past medical history significant for liver <br>cirrhosis secondary to sarcoidosis, upper GI bleeding due to esophageal <br>varices which were subsequently banded, iron-deficiency anemia, portal vein <br>thrombosis (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis that was diagnosed <br>seven months prior presented with subacute worsening of abdominal pain. The <br>abdominal pain was severe and localized to the midepigastric region <br>associated with nausea without vomiting, BRBPR or melena. On physical <br>examination, patient had stable vital signs. Her abdomen was soft, nontender <br>and nondistended with active bowel sounds. CT scan revealed a greater degree <br>of thrombosis in the superior mesenteric vein and portal vein (PV) with <br>tortuous mesenteric vessels presumably collaterals. Hypercoagulable workup <br>revealed a mildly elevated antidcardiolipin (aCL) IgM of 19 MPL/ml, while <br>the remainder of the antiphospholipid panel was negative. Factor V Leiden, <br>Factor II Prothrombin, Protein S deficiency and JAK-2 mutation (screening <br>for myeloproliferative disorder) were negative. Protein C was low at 49 % <br>(normal range 74-151). The patient was managed conservatively with IV fluids <br>and pain control. Her abdominal pain improved during the hospital stay. <br>DISCUSSION: <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy was contemplated for several reasons. <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> could lead to recanalization of the PV <br>and prevent progression of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. The worsening thrombosis, reduced level of <br>protein C and elevated aCL IgM were concerning for a possible underlying <br>prothrombotic disorder contributing to the <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. However, the lowered protein <br>C could have been an acquired condition due to the patient's liver <br>cirrhosis. In addition, aCL IgMhas been found in 18.8 % of patients with <br>chronic liver disease unrelated to thrombosis and was considered an <br>epiphenomenon of chronic liver damage. Even among patients with systemic <br>lupus erythematosus, aCL antibodies were not an independent risk factor for <br>thrombosis-related event. Furthermore, portal vein recanalization is more <br>likely to be achieved if <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was initiated within 6 months of <br>diagnosis. Our patient was diagnosed with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> seven months prior. Finally, <br>the clinical benefits of PVrecanalization in this particular patient are <br>uncertain. Mortality benefits have only been demonstrated in individuals <br>with <span style="color: red">PVT</span>on the waiting list for liver transplant. Even though patients with <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span> treated with <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> did not have significant esophageal <br>variceal bleeding, the risk of bleeding was taken into consideration given <br>this patient's known prior bleeding. Finally, the <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is likely due to <br>reduced flow in the portal system. After careful deliberation, the decision <br>was made not to anticoagulate. As of nine months of follow-up, no further <br>complications have developed.<br><br>RECORD 391<br>Do all post-liver transplant patients need thrombo-prophylactic <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>?<br>Mukerji A.

Majority liver transplant (LT) patients have thrombocytopenia and/or <br>prolonged INR before surgery, which is a special challenger There is a lack <br>of studies or guidelines regarding role of prophylactic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>after LT. Aim: Discuss routine prophylactic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> after LT, <br>Discussion: Risk of DVT after major general surgery without prophylaxis is <br>25%, of PE 1,6% and fatal PE 0,9% and are considered preventable. With <br>prophylaxis the incidence of DVT is 7-8% (70% decrease) and fatal PEs <br>decreased two-thirds. On the other hand, the incidence of major bleeding <br>following surgery with prophylactic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was 3,6-4.S% with no <br>significant increase due to <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. Occurrence of wound hematomas <br>Increased, but did not affect mortality. However, after LT without <br>prophylactic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, incidence of major bleeding needing <br>transfusions/reoperation was 8.4-27%, which was significantly higher than <br>after general surgery. The incidence of DVT was 2,7% and PF. 1%, presenting <br>after y mean of 70 and 128 days following the surgery. This was <br>significantly lower than in general surgery and also presented later. Most <br>proven fatal PEs In Lis were intra-operative. Of special importance after <br>LT. the incidence of hiepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) was 4.2% with 52,8% <br>long term mortality and 53.1% re-transplant rate. The incidence of portal <br>vein thrombosis (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) following LT was 22-2.6%, with in hospital mortality <br>of 30% and 5-year survival of 65.5 After LT, <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> is not required <br>routinely for DVT/PE prophyiaxis.

Even in them <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> must be <br>started cautiously after INK decreases below -1,5, platelet count is above <br>-50,000 and clinical bleeding ceases. (Table presented) Conclusion: After LT <br>routine <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> for DVT/PL is not needed. It is io be considered <br>judiciously for prophylaxis of HAT and <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in high risk cases (Table 1).<br><br>RECORD 392<br>Optimal treatment duration of venous thrombosis<br>Ageno W. Dentali F. Donadini M.P. Squizzato A.<br>Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013) 11:SUPPL.1 (151-160). Date of <br>Publication: June 2013<br><br>Randomized controlled trials have shown that patients with venous <br>thromboembolism benefit from a minimum of three months of anticoagulant <br>therapy. After this period, it was suggested that patients with an expected <br>annual recurrence rate of < 5% could safely discontinue treatment. Using a <br>population-based approach for stratification, these patients are those with <br>major transient risk factors, and represent the minority. For all other <br>patients, including those with previous episodes of venous thromboembolism, <br>cancer, or unprovoked events, this treatment duration may not be <br>sufficiently protective. Because extending <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> for additional <br>three to nine months does not result in further, long-term reduction of <br>recurrences, indefinite treatment duration should be considered. However, <br>case-fatality rate for major bleeding in patients taking warfarin for more <br>than three months is higher than case-fatality rate of recurrent venous <br>thromboembolism. Thus, an individual patient approach to improve and <br>increase the identification of those who can safely discontinue treatment at <br>three months becomes necessary. Clinical prediction rules or management <br>strategies based on D-dimer levels or residual vein thrombosis have been <br>proposed and need further refinement and validation. Specific bleeding <br>scores are lacking. Meanwhile, the oral direct inhibitors have been proposed <br>as potential alternatives to the vitamin K antagonists, and aspirin may <br>provide some benefit in selected patients who discontinue <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. <br>Deep vein thrombosis in unusual sites is associated with less, but <br>potentially more severe recurrences, in particular in patients with <br>splanchnic vein thrombosis who also face an increased risk of bleeding <br>complications while on treatment. © 2013 International Society on Thrombosis <br>and Haemostasis.<br><br>RECORD 393<br>Pus, thrombosis and fusobacterium necrophorum infection: A recurrent theme<br>Sandouk Z.

Date of <br>Publication: June 2013<br><br>LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1: Recognize Fusobacterium necrophorum infection as a <br>possible etiology for <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. LEARNING OBJECTIVE 2: Manage <br>Fusobacterium necrophorum infection and its complications: thromboembolic <br>events, abscess and sepsis. CASE: A 56 years old man with history of heavy <br>alcohol use, presented to the hospital with complaints of weight loss, right <br>upper quadrant pain and night sweats for 1 month. His laboratory findings <br>were normal except for normocytic anemia. Hepatitis panel, HIV, blood and <br>urine cultures were negative. Tuberculosis was ruled out. Ultrasound of the <br>abdomen revealed right <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> without liver or gallbladder <br>abnormalities. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was started and malignancy work up was <br>performed, including CT chest, abdomen and pelvis, endoscopy and <br>colonoscopy. No suspicious masses or lymph nodes were detected. Thrombotic <br>work up was negative. The patient did not have any recorded fever while in <br>the hospital, was stable and discharged with warfarin. He returns a month <br>later with the same complaints. Work up included blood, urine and fungal <br>cultures (fungitell, galactoman, and urine for histoplasma) all of which <br>were negative. A repeat CT abdomen reveals interval development of an <br>abscess within the right hepatic lobe measuring 8.8×6.8 cm. He was started <br>on empiric ceftriaxone and metronidazole. One hundred milliliters of white <br>purulent fluid was aspirated. Gram stain of the fluid was negative as were <br>aerobic cultures, but the anaerobic culture grew Fusobacterium necrophorum. <br>Hospital course was complicated by septic shock and development of right <br>sided empyema attributed to contiguous spread of infection from the liver, <br>requiring video assisted thoracoscopy with decortication. Due to the size of <br>the hepatic abscess complete drainage was not feasible, it was decided to <br>treat with oral metronidazole for several weeks, with planned reevaluation <br>by CT as outpatient. DISCUSSION: Fusobacterium necrophorum is an anaerobic <br>gramnegative bacillus that belongs to the normal oropharyngeal flora. It is <br>associated with septic venous thrombosis, Lemierre's disease, in which <br>thrombosis of the internal jugular vein is precipitated by an upper <br>respiratory infection. Primary foci of F. necrophorum infection in sites <br>other than the head are uncommon, but can occur in the urogenital or <br>gastrointestinal tracts. Clinical features include fever, dyspnea, malaise, <br>and night sweats. The infection is most often recognized with isolation of <br>the bacteria from a sterile body site (blood or abscesses). Compared with <br>Lemierre's syndrome, illness due to primary foci caudal to the head carries <br>a higher mortality rate. Complications include abscesses and septicemia. <br>Metronidazole has been found to be the drug of choice, with duration of <br>treatment from 3 to 6 weeks. Response to antibiotics is slow because of the <br>endovascular nature of the infection. Our patient is responding slower than <br>expected with planned longer duration of antimicrobials in the setting of an <br>undrainable abscess. Therapeutic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> to prevent thromboembolic <br>complications is controversial. It is used most frequently for patients with <br>an underlying thrombophilia, a cerebral infarct, cavernous sinus thrombosis, <br>and refractory disease. The most beneficial role of surgery is associated <br>with drainage of the abscess within the neck, lung or liver. Finally, it is <br>important to exclude underlying malignancy with nonhead primary foci as up <br>to 69 % of patients have underlying malignancies of the affected system.<br><br>RECORD 394<br>Living donor liver transplantation in a case of Budd Chiari syndrome with <br>IVC stent and <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>: A case report<br>Sood G. Chorasiya V. Makki K. Lalwani S. Dargan P. Vij V.<br>Liver Transplantation (2013) 19:6 SUPPL. 1 (S307-S308). Date of Publication: <br>June 2013<br><br>Background: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> is seen in 15-20% eases of Budd Chiari <br>Syndrome (BCS) and it generally signifies poor prognosis. Traditionally <br>cadaveric liver transplantation has been advocated for these patients as <br>most of them require excision of Inferior Vena Cava (IVC), However scarcity <br>of cadaveric organs and development of innovative techniques have allowed <br>the performance of living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) in this group. <br>The presence of metal stent in IVC further complicates the issue. We herein <br>report our experience of performing LDLT in one such ease. Methods: We have <br>performed LDLT in 2 cases of BCS oat of 37 from December 2011 till December <br>2012. We report a case of 33 year old male with protein C deficiency that <br>was diagnosed with BCS and <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) three years ago. He <br>had a (ailed attempt of TIPS and an IVC stent was inserted in a different <br>center. As his bilirubin was progressively increasing and he had failed <br>medical and interventional therapy he was listed for LDLT. His sister was <br>evaluated as a donor and screened for Protein C deficiency which was <br>negative. Surgery: Eversion thrombectomy was done to completely remove the <br>thrombus from the portal vein. IVC was mobilized up to the atrium after <br>phreno-caval dissociation. The anastomoses of the Right hepatic vein, Middle <br>hepatic vein and inferior hepatic vein was done above the stent after <br>extending these veins with cadaveric iliac vessels. Results: The <br>post-operative recovery was uneventful. His protein C level was normal in <br>the 2nd week, after transplantation and he was discharged in the 3rd week <br>without any <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. Follow up triple phase CT revealed patent flow <br>in the portal as well as hepatic veins. He continues to do well f months <br>after the surgery and his serum bilirubin is normal Conclusions This paper <br>is an attempt to add to already emerging data that LDLT tit BCS is safe and <br>effective even in the presence of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. Even in difficult <br>cases with IVC stent in situ, it might be possible to preserve the IVC.<br><br>RECORD 395<br>Catastrophe!<br>Atreya A.R. Kitt E. Besharatian B. Verma A. DeMatteo M.<br>Journal of General Internal Medicine (2013) 28 SUPPL. 1 (S304-S305). Date of <br>Publication: June 2013<br><br>LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1: Recognize early the challenging diagnosis of <br>Catastrophic Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome (CAPS), in order to direct <br>management appropriately as the condition is life-threatening. CASE: KP, a <br>26 years old African-American male with SLE, noncompliant with his <br>outpatient steroid therapy, presented with 3 days of constitutional symptoms <br>and was found to have acute kidney injury, pancreatitis, profound anemia <br>needing transfusion (Hb 5.7), thrombocytopenia, acute decompensated heart <br>failure with troponin elevation. Echocardiogram showed global hypokinesis <br>with regional areas of akinesis, suggestive of infarction. He was started on <br>high dose steroids for presumed SLE flare. Subsequently, he had massive <br>upper GI bleed; EGD revealed gastritis as well as esophageal varices. US of <br>liver revealed <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> with cavernous transformation and <br>splenic vein thrombosis. His renal function worsened necessitating dialysis. <br>He became more somnolent with development of neurological deficits; CSF <br>analysis showed no signs of infection and an MRI demonstrated disseminated <br>sub-acute ischemic infarcts. At this point, concern for a more serious <br>condition such as concomitant antiphospholipid syndrome was raised. Renal <br>biopsy showed multifocal arterial and arteriolar thrombi, consistent with <br>CAPS. There was no evidence of lupus nephritis. Positive serology <br>(anti-cardiolipin IgM 25 ug/mL) helped confirm diagnosis of CAPS and he was <br>started on <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, cyclophosphamide and plasmapheresis. Eventually, <br>KP recovered from his cataclysmic disease and was discharged to a <br>rehabilitation center with long-term warfarin and prednisone therapy. <br>DISCUSSION: Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS) was first <br>described by Ronald Asherson in 1992 and is diagnosed using the <br>classification criteria proposed by the International Congress on <br>Antiphospholipid in 2011. This includes the presence of all of the <br>following: evidence of involvement of≤3 organs; manifestations occurring <br>simultaneously or in less than 1 week; histopathological confirmation and <br>serological confirmation (anticardiolipin/lupus anticoagulant/anti-beta2 <br>glycoprotein antibodies). Although this condition is fairly uncommon in <br>patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (<1 %), it is a life-threatening <br>condition with greater than 50 % mortality. The pathogenesis of this disease <br>is still unclear, but it is postulated that certain triggers (eg. infection) <br>facilitate a 'cytokine storm' that promotes inflammation and thrombosis. <br>Treatment options include <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, steroids, cyclophosphamide, <br>plasmapheresis. Additional therapies such as rituximab, eculizumab and IVIG <br>have been used with some success for refractory CAPS. In our patient, the <br>presence of cerebral infarcts, myocardial infarcts, renal thrombosis, <br>ischemic gastritis, <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>, pancreatic injury within a short <br>duration raised concerns for a serious disorder. Histological and <br>serological tests confirmed the diagnosis. Despite lack of experience with <br>this disorder, prompt review of medical literature and early sub-specialist <br>consultation were vital to ensure a favorable outcome.<br><br>RECORD 396<br>Vascular outcomes in segmental liver transplantation<br>Rodriguez-Davaios M.I.

Date of Publication: June <br>2013<br><br>Anticoagulant therapy is a cornerstone in the treatment of different liver <br>diseases. In Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS), survival rates have increased <br>considerably since the introduction of a treatment strategy in which <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> is the treatment of first choice. In all patients diagnosed <br>with acute <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>), anticoagulant therapy for at least <br>3 months is indicated. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> should also be considered in patients <br>with chronic <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and a concurrent prothrombotic risk factor. Current <br>evidence suggests that patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in cirrhosis will benefit from <br>treatment with <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> as well. In severe chronic liver disease the <br>levels of both pro- and anticoagulant factors are decreased, resetting the <br>coagulant balance in an individual patient and making it more prone to <br>deviate to a hypo- or hypercoagulable state. An increased activity of the <br>coagulation cascade is not solely a feature of chronic liver disease; it <br>influences the development of liver fibrosis as well.

There is limited data regarding the role of <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy in patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span>. <br>Objectives: The aims of this study were to describe the prevalence of <br>hypercoagulable disorders in patients with <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> and <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, and to <br>describe the outcome of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in patients with <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> and <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted of patients with <br><span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> awaiting liver transplant who were diagnosed with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>between January 2005 and November 2011. Results: During the study period, <br>537 patients were evaluated for liver transplant. Sixty-nine (13 %) patients <br>were diagnosed with <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. Chronic hepatitis C was the <br>cause of liver disease in 24/69 (35 %) patients, and hepatocellular <br>carcinoma was present in 39 % of patients. In 22 patients screened for <br>hypercoagulable disorders, hypercoagulable disorder was diagnosed in one <br>patient (5 %). Twenty-eight (28/69) patients were treated during the study <br>period with warfarin: <span style="color: red">PVT</span> resolved in 11/28 (39 %), no change in 5/28 (18 <br>%), and 12/28 (43 %) patients showed partial resolution of thrombus.

Methods: Between Jan 2006 and Dec 2010, 150 patients <br>transplanted for chronic liver disease were screened for aPL-ab (IgG and IgM <br>isotypes) and lupus anticoagulant activity. Clinical and Doppler-ultrasound <br>evaluations were performed before OLT and at different time-points <br>post-transplant. Results were compared with aPL-ab negative patients. All <br>patients received aspirin and/or low weight heparin post-OLT. Median <br>follow-up: 26 months (12-56), Results: 39/150 patients (24%) evidenced <br>increased levels of aPL-ab pre-OLT. Child C patients had a lower prevalence <br>of aPL-ab than Child B patients (21 vs 32 %. p NS). No difference was <br>observed in renal or liver function tests, except for bilirrubin levels <br>which were higher in aPL-ab + patients (5.9 vs 3.6 mg/dl, p=0.04). Seven <br>thrombotic complications were observed in 6/36 aPL + patients post-OLT <br>(humeral thrombosis, n=1, cerebrovascular ischemia n=3, hepatic artery <br>thrombosis n=1, retinal thrombosis=1, intestinal ischemia n=1) resulting in <br>one graft loss and one death, compared to nine thrombotic complications in <br>8/114 patients aPL negative resulting in one graft loss and <br>re-transplantation (p<0.05).

Date of Publication: May <br>2013<br><br>Aim: Outcomes of patients developing portal vein (PV) thrombosis (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) after <br>distal pancreatectomy (DP) are unknown. The goal of this study was to <br>identify risk factors for <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and describe the long term outcomes in these <br>patients. Methods: Patients undergoing DP without repair or reconstruction <br>of the PV between 2001 and 2011 were included. Patients that showed evidence <br>of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> on pre-operative imaging were excluded from the study. Location and <br>extent of thrombosis was determined by postoperative CT or ultrasound <br>imaging in all patients. Evidence of systemic thrombosis (if present) in <br>addition to <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was also documented. Results: In the study period, 991 <br>patients underwent DP and 21 (2.1 %) patients were diagnosed with <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. <br>Pancreatic neoplasm was the most frequent indication for operation (n = 11). <br>Thrombus occurred in the main PV in 15 and the right branch of the PV in 8 <br>patients. Complete PV occlusion occurred in 9 patients with a median time to <br>diagnosis of 16 days (range 5 - 85 days). Seventeen patients were <br>anticoagulated for a median duration of 6 months (range 3.3 - 36 months) <br>after the diagnosis of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Over a median follow up of 22 months, resolution <br>of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> occurred in 7 patients. Predictors of non-resolution of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> included <br>anesthesia time .180 minutes (p = 0.025), DM type II (p = 0.03), BMI .30 <br>Kg/m2 (p = 0.03), occlusive <span style="color: red">PVT</span> (p <0.001), or thrombus in a sectoral branch <br>(p = 0.02). <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy did not influence the frequency of <br>thrombus resolution and was complicated by gastrointestinal hemorrhage in 4 <br>patients. There was no mortality as a direct result of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> or <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. Conclusion: <span style="color: red">PVT</span> after distal pancreatectomy is a rare <br>complication. Serious complications as a direct result of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in this <br>setting are uncommon and are not dependent on thrombus resolution.

Date of Publication: <br>May 2013<br><br>Clinical report: We describe the case of a 42 years old woman affected by a <br>myeloproliferative neoplasm diagnosed 20 years ago, treated with <br>oncocarbide. In September 2012 the patient experienced abdominal pain and a <br>complete extrahepatic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> with patent hepatic veins and <br>important splenomegaly was diagnosed by CT-scan. She had a severe portal <br>hypertension with esophageal varices F2-F3 with cherry red spots and gastric <br>varices F2. We excluded inherited thrombophilia. The JAK2 mutation was <br>found. Management: The patient underwent endoscopic variceal ligation.

Conclusions: The close relationship <br>between myeloproliferative neoplasms and splanchnic vein thrombosis has been <br>confirmed by the current one third prevalence of the JAK2 mutation among <br>patients with Budd Chiari syndrome and extrahepatic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. <br>The JAK2 mutation is associated with hypercoagulability and carriers are <br>more prone to thrombosis. The management of anticoagulant therapy in <br>patients with extrahepatic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> and esofaeal varices is <br>difficult because of the balance between bleeding and thrombotic risk. <br>Long-term oral <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> with vitamin K antagonists is recommended in <br>patients with extrahepatic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> and permanent <br>prothrombotic state.<br><br>RECORD 403<br>Shunt surgery for extra hepatic portal venous obstruction: Keeping it simple<br>Bhalla V.P. Vij J.C. Vats R. Goel D.<br>Gastroenterology (2013) 144:5 SUPPL. 1 (S914). Date of Publication: May 2013<br><br>Aim To present a simple cost effective and innovative approach for surgical <br>shunting to lower portal pressures and compare the same with the more <br>complex REX shunt. Background Beginning with the Eck fistula, surgical <br>shunts for lowering portal pressures have always been an interesting <br>proposition. During the 80's and 90's many centres had impressive series of <br>portosystemic shunts. About this time endoscopic management strategies <br>developed rapidly and proved invaluable in management of bleeding varices <br>associated with portal hypertension (PHT) and interest in surgical shunting <br>waned. Introduction of the REX shunt for bypassing an extrahepatic portal <br>block by performing a mesenterico left portal shunt has again brought <br>surgery for patients with extrahepatic portal obstruction with good liver <br>function back into reckoning. The REX shunt was initially described for <br>paediatric patients with extrahepatic obstruction. While it is a good shunt <br>to lower portal pressure even while it maintains hepatofugal blood flow it <br>is challenging to plan and technically demanding to learn and perform. <br>Indian experience suggests that the proximal leinorenal shunt is a simpler <br>shunt which is relatively easy to learn and do. There is no need for <br>elaborate imaging studies to plan the shunt and often a simple abdominal <br>ultrasonography has been used for planning surgery. Also pressure monitoring <br>including wedge hepatic venous pressure gradient is possibly not essential <br>in making management decisions for diagnosed PHT with good liver function. <br>Compared to this the Rex shunt needs elaborate angiography and involves <br>operating in the region of the porta hepatis often in the presence of <br>collaterals. The left portal branch may also be involved by the extending <br>main portal vein thrombus and there is a need for an interposition <br>autologous or synthetic graft. Patients and methods The comparison with the <br>REX shunt is based on a twenty year experience from 1993-2012 of 92 patients <br>who underwent surgical shunting for portal hypertension with good liver <br>function. The commonest causes of PHT were <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> and non <br>cirrhotic portal fibrosis in 72/ 92 cases. GI bleeding in 66/92 patients was <br>the commonest indication for shunting. Diagnosis of PHT in a patient with a <br>GI bleed was based on the presence of splenomegaly on clinical examination <br>and demonstrated esophageal varices on endoscopy. The abdominal ultrasound <br>provided adequate information to plan surgery. The procedure performed was <br>splenectomy with a Proximal Leino Renal shunt. No routine post shunt <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was used. No post shunt hepatic encephalopathy was <br>encountered in this group. Shunt patency rate was 86% at one year follow up. <br>Conclusion The simple management plan suggested may well be a better <br>treatment option than the REX shunt.<br><br>RECORD 404<br>Percutaneous microwave ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma with <br>high-powered, gas-cooled antennas: 24-month experience in 63 patients<br>Ziemlewicz T. Hinshaw L. Lubner M. Brace C.L. Alexander M. Sampson L. Lee <br>Jr. F.T.<br>Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2013) 24:5 (759.e9). Date <br>of Publication: May 2013<br><br>Objectives: Microwave (MW) ablation is a promising technology that offers <br>several advantages over radiofrequency (RF) ablation including: faster <br>heating, higher (more lethal) tissue temperatures, improved consistency in <br>different tissue types, and potentially greater ablation zone sizes. The <br>purpose of this study was to retrospectively review the results in the first <br>63 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with a high-power, <br>gas-cooled MW device at a single center. Methods: Between December 2010 and <br>December 2012 we treated 91 hepatocellular carcinomas in 63 patients via a <br>percutaneous approach utilizing US and/or CT guidance. There were 54 male <br>and 9 female patients with mean age of 61 years (range 44-83). All <br>procedures were performed with a high-powered, gas-cooled microwave system <br>(Certus 140, Neuwave Medical, Madison, WI) utilizing 1-3 (mean 1.7) 17- <br>gauge antennas. Antenna power and ablation time was determined by the <br>performing physician based on lesion size, location, and imaging findings. <br>Mean power was 78 W (range 35-140 W) and mean ablation time was 5.7 minutes <br>(range 1-15 minutes). 12 tumors in 10 patients were treated with <br>chemoembolization at the time of or within 3 weeks preceding microwave <br>ablation (7 patients with tumors >4 cm and 3 patients where the tumor(s) <br>could not be identified by ultrasound). Follow-up imaging was performed <br>immediately post-ablation and at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months with <br>contrast-enhanced CT or MRI. Results: Tumors ranged in size from 0.5 to 6.0 <br>cm (mean 2.5 cm) and median followup was 10 months. All treatments were <br>considered technically successful with no evidence of residual tumor at <br>immediate post-procedure CECT. Primary treatment effectiveness was 89.0% <br>(80/91) for all tumors, 94.7% (74/79) for tumors < 4 cm, and 58.3% (7/12) <br>for tumors > 4 cm. Primary treatment effectiveness for tumors > 3 cm and < 4 <br>cm was 100% (9/9). Secondary effectiveness via local regional therapy (LRT) <br>was 98.8% (85/86), with one patient awaiting repeat microwave ablation. 5 <br>tumor progressions were excluded from secondary effectiveness analysis as <br>they were noted only at explant pathology and therefore there was not <br>opportunity for retreatment. Of the tumor progression in lesions <4 cm <br>(n=5); 3 were treated with little or no margin due to compromised hepatic <br>function or proximity to a critical structure and 2 were identified as only <br>microscopic foci at explant pathology (by H&E staining, no viability <br>staining was performed). A single minor complication occurred (1.6%), a main <br>portal vein thrombus following ablation of a caudate lobe lesion which was <br>noted at 1 month follow-up and resolved with anti-coagulation. There were no <br>major complications. A patient died 8 days following the procedure secondary <br>to a pneumonia for which he refused treatment. There was no procedure <br>related mortality. Overall survival is 85.7% at median 10 month follow-up <br>with deaths related to end stage liver disease (n=4), multifocal HCC/ESLD <br>(n=3), transplant complications (n=1), or pneumonia (n=1). Conclusions: 24 <br>month experience treating hepatocellular carcinoma using a highpowered, <br>gas-cooled microwave ablation system is safe with excellent local control. <br>Prior RF studies have noted a substantial drop in efficacy when tumors <br>exceed 3.0 cm in diameter. In this study local control of HCC by MW ablation <br>was excellent in tumors up to 4.0 cm in size. Continued study is warranted <br>to determine durability of treatment and survival with longer follow-up.<br><br>RECORD 405<br>Isolated superior mesenteric venous thrombophlebitis with acute appendicitis<br>Karam M.M. Abdalla M.F. Bedair S.<br>International Journal of Surgery Case Reports (2013) 4:4 (432-434). Date of <br>Publication: 2013<br><br>INTRODUCTION: Isolated superior mesentericveinous thrmbophlebitis is a <br>rarely recognised condition associated with a high morbidity. It usually <br>develops secondary to infection in the drainage area of the portal venous <br>system, like appendix. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We report a case of neglected <br>perforated acute appendicitis complicated by superior mesenteric venous <br>pyelephlebitis patiant represented with a vague pain to right of umlicus, <br>which is atypical this why cat scan was done and showed obstructed <br>superiormesentric vein, portal vein was free with acute appendicitis. <br>Appendicectomy and treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, and platelets led to a full recovery. Follow-up imaging <br>after one month revealed complete canalization of superior mesentric vein. <br>DISCUSSION: Abdominal pain if atypical like our case report need imaging <br>diagnosis. Modern diagnostic imaging techniques help the early diagnosis of <br>acute phase pylephlebitis. CT can detect primary source of infection, extent <br>of pylephlebitis, CT scan is the most reliable initially. Ultrasound scan <br>with color flow Doppler is also a sensitive test for confirming partial <br>patency of the portal vein and <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> accidentally <br>discovered complete obliteration of superior mesenteric vein with thrombosis <br>which remained not propagated by serial Doppler ultrasound of liver. <br>Appropriate treatment should be initiated as soon as possible. To avoid <br>extension to portal vein. The principal treatment for pylephlebitis is to <br>remove the source of infection as appendicectomy. Anticoagulants must be <br>used. Regarding the treatment of portal thrombosis, post operative use of <br>heparin has been advocated. CONCLUSION: Cat scan play an important role in <br>case of atypical abdominal pain. © 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf <br>of Surgical Associates Ltd.<br><br>RECORD 406<br>Predictors of response to anticoagulant therapy for the treatment of portal <br>vein thrombosis (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) in cirrhosis patients<br>Rodríguez-Castro K.I. Sartori M.T. Radu C.M. Gavasso S. Zerbinati P. <br>Bortoluzzi I. Nadal E. Simioni P. Burra P. Senzolo M.<br>Journal of Hepatology (2013) 58 SUPPL. 1 (S101). Date of Publication: April <br>2013<br><br>Background and Aims: <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> has been demonstrated to be effective <br>in the treatment of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>; however, it is not known which factors predict the <br>therapeutic response. The purpose of this study was to assess hemostatic <br>status (pro- and anti-coagulant factors), and thrombus and patient <br>characteristics as predictors of therapeutic efficacy of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. <br>Patients and Methods: 46 cirrhotics with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> who received <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>therapy with LMWH were retrospectively evaluated. Nadroparin 95 IU/Kg was <br>administered to all patients (40% dose reduction if <50.000×109/L <br>platelets). Interval between <span style="color: red">PVT</span> onset and start of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was <br>estimated. All patients underwent thrombophilia screening and dosing of <br>plasmatic proand anti-coagulation factors. Coagulation imbalance was further <br>evaluated using the FactorVIII/Protein C ratio. Vessel recanalization was <br>evaluated monthly using abdominal ultrasound and every 3 months by CT scan. <br>Results: 34 patients were male and mean age was 58±11 years. Etiology of <br>cirrhosis was viral in 47.8% and alcohol-related in 32.6% of cases. Partial <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span> was found in 36/46 patients. Estimated interval from appearance of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>and start of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was ≤6 months in 35/46, and >6 months in the <br>remaining 11 cases. Thrombophilic mutations were found in 4 patients. <br>Recanalization of the portal vein was obtained in 30 patients (24 complete <br>recanalization) after a mean time of 4.5±3.1 months of therapy. No <br>correlation was found between standard coagulation parameters, plasmatic <br>activity of factors VII, IX, XI, AT, PS, PC, fibrinogen, or factor VIII/PC <br>ratio, and thrombus disappearance. Likewise, repermeation did not correlate <br>with the extension of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, presence of thrombophilic mutations, severity of <br>liver disease, or etiology of cirrhosis. An interval between development of <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span> and start of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy <6 months was the only significant <br>predictor of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> efficacy (93% versus 15.2%, p < 0.001) with <br>only 2 patients with older thrombus achieving recanalization after 6 months <br>of therapy. Conclusions: The interval between <span style="color: red">PVT</span> occurrence and start of <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy is the only predictor of recanalization; on the <br>contrary, hemostatic imbalance does not correlate with anticoagulant <br>response.

Date of Publication: <br>April 2013<br><br>The aim of this study was to analyse vascular complications (VC) <br>accompanying the introduction in Estonia of orthotopic liver transplantation <br>(OLT) for treatment of end-stage liver disease. We present the incidence and <br>treatment of VC occurring among our first 23 OLT in 22 patients. The 11 <br>female and 11 male patients were aged 12 to 67 years. Their diagnoses were <br>cholestatic disease (n = 8); hepatitis C virus (HCV) cirrhosis (n = 6); <br>tumor (n = 3); Budd-Chiari syndrome (n = 2); autoimmune hepatitis (n = 1); <br>cystic fibrosis (n = 1); or fulminant hepatic failure (n = 1). Only <br>end-to-end vascular reconstructions were used in OLT. The patients' 1-year <br>post-OLT survival rate was 86%. VC were confirmed using computed tomography <br>(CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In cases of VC, we started a <br>1-week course of subcutaneous anticoagulant therapy with low-molecular <br>weight heparin (LMWH) immediately followed by permanent oral treatment. The <br>incidence of VC was 14% (n = 3). There was no hepatic artery thrombosis. One <br>patient developed hepatic venous thrombosis at 3 weeks after <br>retransplantation. She was treated successfully with immediate LMWH followed <br>by a permanent oral <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. Two patients experienced portal vein <br>complications: 1 with pre-OLT <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> developed right <br>intrahepatic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> at 5 weeks after OLT requiring portal <br>thrombectomy.

Date of Publication: April 2013<br><br>Objective: To describe the incidence of, the patterns of clinical <br>presentation of, and the reasons for portomesenteric vein thrombosis among <br>patients who underwent laparoscopic bariatric surgery. Design: <br>Retrospective, multicenter study. Setting: Six academic bariatric centers. <br>Patients: Morbidly obese patients diagnosed with portomesenteric vein <br>thrombosis following laparoscopic bariatric surgery between January 2007 and <br>June 2012. Main Outcome Measures: Clinical presentation, diagnostic measures <br>used, treatments employed, outcome, and hematologic workup of patients. <br>Results: Of 5706 patients who underwent laparoscopic bariatric surgery, 17 <br>(0.3%) had portomesenteric vein thrombosis, 16 after sleeve gastrectomy and <br>1 following adjustable gastric banding. Seven patients were women, the mean <br>age was 38 years, and the mean body mass index was 44.3. The median time to <br>presentation was 10.1 days, and the median time to diagnosis was 11.7 days. <br>New-onset epigastric pain was present in all patients, whereas other signs <br>and symptoms were sporadically found. Computed tomography was performed and <br>was diagnostic in 16 cases. Ultrasonography was used for 9 patients, and <br>positive results were found for 8 of these patients. Patients were treated <br>by <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> with subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (n=15) or <br>intravenous heparin (n=2), followed by warfarin sodium.

Methods: Retrospective study of all patients with non-cirrhotic <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span> (n = 120), seen at our hospital from 1985 to 2009. Data were collected <br>by systematic chart review. Results: Sixty-six of the 120 patients were <br>treated with anticoagulants. Twenty-two recurrent thrombotic events occurred <br>in 19 patients. The overall thrombotic risk at 1, 5 and 10 years was 4%, 8% <br>and 27%, respectively. Seventy-four percent of all recurrent thrombotic <br>events occurred in patients with a prothrombotic disorder. Anticoagulant <br>therapy tended to lower the risk of recurrent thrombosis (hazard ratio [HR] <br>0.2, P = 0.1), yet the only significant predictor of recurrent thrombotic <br>events was the presence of a prothrombotic disorder (HR 3.1, P = 0.03). In <br>37 patients, 83 gastrointestinal bleeding events occurred. The re-bleeding <br>risk at 1, 5 and 10 years was 19%, 46% and 49%, respectively. <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy (HR 2.0, P ≤ 0.01) was a significant predictor of <br>(re)bleeding. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy had no effect on the severity of <br>gastrointestinal bleeding.

Data collected included tumor location (pancreas vs <br>hepatic), stage, methods of clinical management, timing of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and clinical <br>management. Results: 1072 patients with HPB malignancies (630 pancreas and <br>442 intrahepatic) were evaluated. Tumor location and cancer stage were the <br>only predictors of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> (p = 0.049 and p = 0.042, respectively). Surgical <br>resection, RFA ablation, chemoradiation therapy, and hepatic arterial <br>therapy (HAT) did not potentiate <span style="color: red">PVT</span> (Table 1). Eleven of 41 patients (27%) <br>were treated with <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> for the management of their <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Portal <br>vein recanalization was not achieved in any patient and thrombus progression <br>was seen in 64% of patients despite therapeutic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. Conclusion: <br>Hepatic malignancies are more likely to present with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> whereas pancreatic <br>malignancies are more likely to develop <span style="color: red">PVT</span> as a sign of progression to <br>stage IV disease. The mechanism of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> secondary to HPB malignancy appears <br>to be different than <span style="color: red">PVT</span> of benign conditions and is not amendable to <br>systemic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>.

Date of Publication: <br>February 2013<br><br>Introduction: It is not known which factors predict efficacy of <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in the treatment of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Aim: To assess hemostatic status <br>(pro- and anti-coagulant factors), and thrombus and patient characteristics <br>as predictors of therapeutic efficacy of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. Materials and <br>methods: 46 cirrhotics with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> who were anticoagulated with low molecular <br>weight heparin (LMWH) were retrospectively evaluated. Nadroparin 95 IU/kg <br>was administered to all patients (40% dose reduction if <50,000×109/L <br>platelets). Interval between <span style="color: red">PVT</span> onset and start of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was <br>estimated. All patients underwent thrombophilia screening and dosing of <br>plasmatic pro-and anti-coagulation factors. Coagulation imbalance was <br>further evaluated using the FactorVIII/Protein C ratio. Vessel <br>recanalization was evaluated monthly using abdominal ultrasound and every 3 <br>months by CT scan. Results: 34 patients were male and mean age was 58±11 <br>years. Etiology of cirrhosis was viral in 47.8% and alcohol-related in 32.6% <br>of cases. Partial <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was found in 36/46 patients. Estimated interval from <br>appearance of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and start of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was £6 months in 35/46. <br>Thrombophilic mutations were found in 4 patients. Recanalization was <br>obtained in 30 patients (24 complete recanalization) after a mean time of <br>4.5±3.1 months of therapy. No correlation was found between standard <br>coagulation parameters, plasmatic activity of factors VII, IX, XI, AT, PS, <br>PC, fibrinogen, or FVIII/PC ratio, and thrombus disappearance. Likewise, <br>recanalization did not correlate with the extension of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, presence of <br>thrombophilic mutations, severity or etiology of liver disease. An interval <br>between development of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and start of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy <6 months <br>was the only significant predictor of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> efficacy (93% versus <br>15.2%, p<0.001) Conclusions: the interval between <span style="color: red">PVT</span> onset and start of <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> is the only predictor of recanalization. Hemostatic <br>imbalance does not correlate with anticoagulant response. For patients with <br>recent thrombus, continuation of anticoagulant therapy beyond 6 months could <br>increase the possibility of recanalization.<br><br>RECORD 419<br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>: Should <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> be used?<br>Congly S.E.

Date of <br>Publication: February 2013<br><br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) can contribute to significant morbidity and <br>mortality; in patients with cirrhosis, this can make transplant more <br>technically challenging.

Patients with BCS are found to have oesophageal varices (OV), <br>gastric varices (GV) as well as portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG). <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> is recommended in BCS though not evaluated in randomized <br>trials. The aim of work is to determine feasibility of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in <br>patients with BCS with gastro-esophageal varices. METHODS: 150 patients with <br>BCS were included. All had upper endoscopy. Band ligation was planned for <br>(OV) with red signs or recent bleeding and cyanoacrylate injection for <br>bleeding (GV) or signs of impending hemorrhage before <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. <br>RESULTS: 30 patients (20%) were presented by GI bleeding, 12/30(40%) had <br>large sized OV with (GV) in 3 of them, all had band ligation with <br>cyanoacrylate injection of the (GV) before <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. The remaining 18 <br>had PHG with medium sized non risky varices in 12/30 (40%) and small OV in <br>6/30 (20%). Only 2/30 (6.6%) had GI bleeding after <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> with <br>overall survival of 10.4 months. Among 120 patients who were not presented <br>by GI bleeding, 18/120 (15%) had large OV, 57/120 (47.5%) had PHG with small <br>or medium sized OV, one patient had isolated large (GV), and 44 patients had <br>neither OV nor PHG. All were anticoagulated after band ligation of risky <br>varices. 23 (19%) out of 120 died, only 3 (2.5%) due to GI bleeding with <br>overall survival of 12.3 months. CONCLUSIONS: <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in BCS is <br>feasible after band ligation of large or medium sized OV with red signs. <br>History of GI bleeding should not be a contraindication for <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>in BCS. © 2013 ACT.<br><br>RECORD 421<br>Diagnosis and endovascular treatment of common vascular complications in the <br>post liver transplant patient<br>Lancaster M. Rosenkrantz J. Salsamendi J. Pereira K.<br>Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2013) 24:1 <br>(145.e4-145.e5). Date of Publication: January 2013<br><br>Purpose: To describe and review the diagnosis and endovascular treatment of <br>common vascular complications of liver transplant. Materials and Methods: 1) <br>Review of the literature regarding vascular complications of liver <br>transplant, with particular attention to those complications commonly <br>diagnosed and treated by the Interventional Radiologist. 2) Discussion of a <br>case example of one such complication, portal vein stenosis, recently <br>treated by balloon dilatation and stenting at our institution. 3) Review and <br>discussion of other case examples from the literature or our institutional <br>experience, pertaining to other vascular complications. Results: Vascular <br>complications after liver transplant are not infrequently encountered. These <br>include hepatic artery thrombosis and stenosis, as well as stenosis of the <br>portal vein, hepatic veins, and IVC. <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> can also be <br>seen. With the exception of hepatic artery thrombosis, these are often <br>treated with balloon dilatation and/or stenting with satisfactory results. <br>In the case of hepatic artery thrombosis, selective thrombolytic injection <br>can be employed in the affected branch, although stenting and/or balloon <br>dilatation may still be required for a concomitant hepatic artery stenosis. <br>In addition, combinations of anti-platelet therapy and <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> are <br>often utilized in conjunction with stent placement. As an example of one <br>such complication, we discuss a relatively uncommon case of portal vein <br>stenosis. Incidentally, the stenosis was of such severity that it caused <br>post stenotic aneurysmal dilatation of more proximal portion, which has not <br>been previously reported to our knowledge. Portal venous stenoses are <br>relatively uncommon, being reported in approximately 3% of cases. There are <br>various post treatment medical management related issues to address as well, <br>such as the type and duration of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> to use and when the patient <br>should return for routine follow-up. Conclusion: In conclusion, we review <br>the common vascular complications that can be seen after liver transplant, <br>using a case of portal vein stenosis and associated post stenotic dilatation <br>of the portal vein as an example. Generally speaking, they are relatively <br>infrequent, occurring in as many as 5% of patients. Yet, a working <br>familiarity with these complications and expected subsequent management is <br>useful, particularly at smaller centers or community hospitals where there <br>is no transplant program. These important considerations are discussed and <br>addressed in this concise review of the topic.<br><br>RECORD 422<br>Impact of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> on outcomes in acute non-cirrhotic and <br>non-malignant <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>: A retrospective observational study<br>Hall T.C. Garcea G. Metcalfe M. Bilk D. Rajesh A. Dennison A.<br>Hepato-Gastroenterology (2013) 60:121 (311-317). Date of Publication: <br>January-February 2013<br><br>Background/Aims: No definitive evidence exists regarding the treatment of <br>acute <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>). Treatment modalities that have been <br>employed and investigated include conservative management, <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, <br>thrombolysis and thrombectomy. This observational study examines the impact <br>of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> on <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Methodology: The electronic radiology database <br>was searched with keywords 'portal vein' and 'thrombosis'. Relevant patient <br>notes and imaging were reviewed to collect data from those with acute <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. <br>The primary end point was portal vein recanalisation. Secondary outcome <br>measures were morbidity and the development of portal hypertension and its <br>sequelae (including variceal bleeding). Data from patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in the <br>context of cirrhosis, malignancy or liver transplant were excluded. Results: <br>Partial or complete recanalization of the portal vein occurred in 81.8% of <br>anticoagulated patients and 37.5% of the non-treatment group. Five patients <br>died, 1 following an intracranial haemorrhage whilst anticoagulated and <br>another who was not treated and developed secondary small bowel ischaemia <br>and peritonitis. The remaining 3 died from their underlying pathology. Late <br>complications, such as varices and ascites occurred more frequently in the <br>patients in whom the portal vein failed to recanalize (83.3% vs. 27.3%). <br>Conclusions: Spontaneous resolution of acute <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> is <br>uncommon. Early <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> results in a higher rate of recanalisation <br>with minimal associated morbidity when compared with no treatment. © H.G.E. <br>Update Medical Publishing S.A.<br><br>RECORD 423<br>The management of mesenteric vein thrombosis: A single institution's <br>experience<br>Yanar F.

Date of <br>Publication: 2013<br><br>BACKGROUND Mesenteric vein thrombosis occurs rarely and is responsible for <br>approximately 5-15% of all cases of acute mesenteric ischemia. The aim of <br>this report was to discuss the management of mesenteric vein thrombosis <br>based on our experience with 34 patients. METHODS In the present study, 34 <br>patients who were admitted to our emergency surgery department between <br>January 2007 and January 2010 with a diagnosis of acute mesenteric vein <br>thrombosis were assessed retrospectively. Patients with peritoneal signs <br>first underwent diagnostic laparoscopy to rule out perforation or bowel <br>gangrene. We performed a second-look laparoscopy within 72 hours of the <br>first operation. All patients were administered 100 mg/kg of the <br>anticoagulant enoxaparin twice daily. In the 6th and 12th months of follow <br>up, CT angiography was performed to evaluate recanalization of the veins. <br>RESULTS CT angiography revealed superior mesenteric vein thrombosis in 25 <br>(73%) patients, <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in 24 (70%) patients, and splenic <br>vein thrombosis in 12 (35%) patients. Eleven patients with peritoneal signs <br>underwent diagnostic laparoscopy; eight of the patients underwent small <br>bowel resection, anastomosis, and trocar insertion. During second-look <br>laparoscopy, small bowel ischemia was found in two patients and re-resection <br>was performed. CONCLUSION Early diagnosis with CT angiography, surgical and <br>nonsurgical blood flow restoration, proper <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, and supportive <br>intensive care are the cornerstones of successful treatment of mesenteric <br>vein thrombosis.<br><br>RECORD 424<br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> prevents <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> and decompensation in <br>patients with cirrhosis<br>Pariente A.<br>Hepato-Gastro and Oncologie Digestive (2013) 20:1 (62-65).

Date of <br>Publication: Nov 2013<br><br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) after liver transplantation is a relatively <br>common but serious complication which could lead to portal hypertension or a <br>direct graft loss. A "Rex" shunt created between the superior mesenteric <br>vein (SMV) and the umbilical portion of the left portal vein can be a useful <br>option to treat <span style="color: red">PVT</span> after pediatric liver transplantation, however, its <br>application to adult patients has not been reported so far because <br>appropriate vein grafts are hardly available. Herein we present a case of <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span> after left lobe living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) who underwent <br>the procedure using the own inferior jugular vein and the gonadal vein as a <br>shunt graft. The shunt was patent immediately after the procedure but was <br>thrombosed 2 days after probably due to the insufficient inflow from the SMV <br>and the absence of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy, for which emergent thrombectomy <br>and ligation of the significant hepatofugal collateral veins followed by <br>full anti-coagulation therapy were performed. The shunt remains open at 8 <br>month after the procedure with a normal anmonia level and liver function. In <br>conclusion, the Rex shunt using recipient's autologous vein grafts is a <br>feasible and valuable option for adult patients to treat <span style="color: red">PVT</span> after LDLT.<br><br>RECORD 427<br>Q: Is <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> appropriate for all patients with portal vein <br>thrombosis?<br>Confer B.D.

Date of <br>Publication: December 2012<br><br>Although hemorrhage has traditionally been regarded as the most significant <br>hemostatic complication of liver disease, there is increasing recognition <br>that hypercoagulability is a prominent aspect of cirrhosis.

The bleeding risk of venous <br>thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis and treatment in patients with chronic <br>liver disease is unclear and there are currently no recommendations to guide <br>practice in this regard. In the present report, the mechanism of coagulation <br>disturbance in chronic liver disease is reviewed with an examination of the <br>evidence for an increased VTE risk in cirrhosis.

Date of Publication: <br>December 2012<br><br>Case Reports: A 71 years old Caucasian female was transferred to intensive <br>care unit with acute abdominal pain and hematemesis. Patient was admitted to <br>medical floor few days ago with the diagnosis of acute idiopathic portal <br>vein thrombosis and thrombocytopenia with platelet count of 35,000. <br>Extensive evaluation did not reveal any specific etiology of <br>thrombocytopenia and hence was diagnosed as immune (idiopathic) <br>thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Prior to her hematemesis, patient was on <br>intravenous argatroban and oral warfarin for idiopathic portal vein <br>thrombosis and on intravenous solumedrol for possible ITP. Emergent CT of <br>the abdomen and pelvis revealed further extension of portal vein thrombus <br>into the distal left splenic and superior mesenteric veins with no evidence <br>of splenomegaly or ascites. INR was 2.5 and platelet count 75,000. <br>Hematocrit dropped from 35.2 to 20.6. All the medications were discontinued <br>and intravenous pantoprazole and octreotide were started. EGD revealed <br>multiple fundic varices and bleeding. Later that day patient developed <br>respiratory failure from fluid overload due to administration of multiple <br>blood transfusions. Patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation <br>but was successfully weaned off after three days. There were no further <br>episodes of variceal bleeding and hematocrit stabilized at 30 and platelet <br>count at 100,000. Patient was subsequently discharged home. Recanalization <br>of portal and superior mesenteric veins was demonstrated on repeat abdominal <br>CT in seven weeks. Platelet count was normal at 219,000 suggesting <br>consumptive thrombocytopenia during patient's hospitalization due to acute <br>thrombosis.

Aggressive management of the consequent life <br>threatening variceal bleed in the ICU led to a favorable outcome. In <br>conclusion, acute idiopathic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> is easily treatable with <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in patients without cirrhosis or malignancy but management <br>becomes extremely challenging when there is associated variceal bleeding and <br>consumptive thrombocytopenia.<br><br>RECORD 430<br>TFPI resistance related to inherited or acquired protein S deficiency<br>Tardy-Poncet B. Piot M. Brunet D. Chapelle C. Bonardel M. Mismetti P. <br>Morange P. Tardy B.<br>Thrombosis Research (2012) 130:6 (925-928). Date of Publication: December <br>2012<br><br>Background: Protein S (PS) is an essential component of the protein C <br>pathway and PS deficiency can explain a poor response to activated protein <br>C. It has recently been shown that PS also acts as a cofactor of Tissue <br>Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI). Objectives: In the present study, we <br>investigated whether PS deficiency could be responsible for a poor response <br>to TFPI. Patients/Methods: Thirty-one patients with inherited PS deficiency, <br>seven pregnant women and 36 controls were enrolled in the study. We measured <br>the plasma response to added TFPI using a two-step diluted prothrombin time <br>(dPT) assay. The response of the different plasmas to the anticoagulant <br>activity of TFPI was expressed as TFPI Normalised Ratio (TFPI NR). Results: <br>The median TFPI NR was statistically significantly lower in patients with <br>inherited PS deficiency (0.5) than in controls (1.0) (p < 0.0001). It was <br>statistically significantly lower in patients with type I inherited PS <br>deficiency (0.47) compared to patients with type III inherited PS deficiency <br>(0.58) (p = 0.018). In contrast, it did not differ between patients with and <br>without thrombosis. Median TFPI NR values were statistically significantly <br>lower during pregnancy (0.54) than 3 months after delivery (0.71) (p = <br>0.016). TFPI NR values correlated well with PS activity values (R(2) = <br>0.681) whatever the nature of the PS deficiency. Conclusions: Our findings <br>confirm that PS deficiency results in a poor anticoagulant response to TFPI, <br>demonstrating again the cofactor role of PS in TFPI activity. © 2012 <br>Elsevier Ltd.

Date of Publication: December <br>2012<br><br>Background & Aims: Women of childbearing age account for approximately 25% <br>of patients with non-cirrhotic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>). We aimed at <br>assessing maternal and fetal outcome in pregnant women with known <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. <br>Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of the files of women with <br>chronic <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in three European referral centers between 1986 and 2010. <br>Results: Forty-five pregnancies, 28 (62%) treated with low molecular weight <br>heparin, occurred in 24 women. Nine (20%) were lost before gestation week <br>20. Preterm birth occurred in 38% of deliveries: there were 3 births at week <br>24-25, 7 at week 32-36, and 26 after week 37. A term birth with a healthy <br>infant occurred in 58% of pregnancies. Cesarean section was used in 53% of <br>deliveries. Two women developed HELLP syndrome. A favorable outcome happened <br>in 64% of pregnancies. Pregnancies with an unfavorable outcome were <br>associated with a higher platelet count at diagnosis. Bleeding from <br>esophageal varices occurred in 3 patients during pregnancy, all without <br>adequate primary prophylaxis. Genital or parietal bleeding occurred <br>postpartum in 4 patients, only one being on <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy. <br>Thrombotic events occurred in 2 patients, none related to lower limbs or <br>mesenteric veins. There were no maternal deaths. Conclusions: In pregnant <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span> patients treated with <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> on an individual basis, the rate <br>of miscarriage and preterm birth appears to be increased. However, fetal and <br>maternal outcomes are favorable for most pregnancies reaching gestation week <br>20. High platelet counts appear to increase the risk for unfavorable <br>outcome.

Yum M.-S. Ko T.-S. Kim K.M.<br>Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2012) 27 SUPPL. 5 (168). Date of <br>Publication: December 2012<br><br>Introduction: Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) are known to have <br>hypercoagulability and an increased risk of venous thromboembolism. The deep <br>veins of the lower extremities and the pulmonary veins are the most common <br>sites of thrombosis in UC. However, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and <br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> are very rare extra-intestinal complications of UC in <br>children. We report the case of a child with newly diagnosed UC who <br>developed both cerebral sinus thrombosis and <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> during <br>an acute exacerbation of disease. Case report: A 12-year-old girl was <br>referred to our hospital with a 1-month history of bloody diarrhea and <br>abdominal pain and a 10-day history of headache, accompanied with nausea and <br>vomiting. The patient had been diagnosed with UC in one week prior to her <br>transfer. At that time she was placed on intravenous steroids and <br>sulfasalazine. She continued to have a worsening headache, and 4 days after <br>admission, she began to complain of right-sided progressive hemiparesis, <br>numbness, and hemiparesthesia. An urgent magnetic resonance imaging <br>angiograph showed superior sagittal sinus thrombosis and cortical vein <br>thrombosis with associated cerebral edema in the left frontal area. Doppler <br>ultrasonography and an abdominal CT scan revealed the portal vein <br>thrombosis. These lesions were successfully treated with conventional <br>management for UC and <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy. The patient was discharged <br>without neurologic sequelae 21 days after admission. Conclusion: This is a <br>rare case of cerebral venous thrombosis and <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> <br>complicated by active UC, in which <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy was successful. <br>Disease activity may play a major role in the occurrence of thrombosis.<br><br>RECORD 436<br>Tamoxifen-associated Budd-Chiari syndrome complicated by heparin-induced <br>thrombocytopenia and thrombosis: A case report and literature review<br>Chayanupatkul M.

Date of Publication: 2012<br><br>We reported a rare case of Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) associated with <br>tamoxifen use, which was later complicated by heparin-induced <br>thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). The patient was a 44 year-old woman <br>with a medical history of lobular carcinoma in situ, who had been on <br>tamoxifen for 2 years, presented with abdominal pain and distention. Imaging <br>studies followed by a liver biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of BCS. On <br>extensive work-up, the patient was found to have an unclassified <br>myeloproliferative disorder with positive JAK-2 V617 mutation. After <br>discontinuing tamoxifen, the patient was started on intravenous heparin. <br>However, later in the course, she developed HITT. Myeloproliferative <br>disorder, in conjunction with tamoxifen, predisposed the patient to be <br>highly thrombophilic resulting in BCS. HITT was found to be relatively <br>common in BCS. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> and blood count need to be carefully <br>monitored, and the possibility of HITT emergence in these patients should <br>always be kept in mind.

Tronina O. Sadowska A. Ba¸czkowska T. Pacholczyk M. Chmura A. <br>Durlik M.<br>Transplantation (2012) 94 SUPPL. 10S (660). Date of Publication: 27 Sep 2012<br><br>Introduction: Antiphospholipid antibodies (APLA) are the most common cause <br>of acquired thrombophilia. After liver transplantation hepatic artery <br>thrombosis (HAT) and <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) frequently lead to graft <br>failure and retransplantation. Objective: The aim of the study was to <br>determine the relation between APLA and liver graft thrombosis. Patients and <br>methods: The study included 33 Caucasian patients after liver <br>transplantation (21 women/12 men, mean time after transplantation 33,9 <br>months) aged 22-74 years. Most patients (57,57%) were given <br>steroids+CNI+MMF, 30% remained on steroids+CNI, 12% - CNI. The patients were <br>divided into 2 groups: 25 patients with no clinical history of thrombosis <br>T(-) and 8 patients T(+) with previous strong thrombotic events (thrombosis <br>1): HAT or <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in previous graft with retransplantation or idiopathic <br>thrombocytopenia (Budd-Chiari syndrome) or deep vein thrombosis (3 episodes) <br>in patients with autoimmune diseases. APLA consist of LA (lupus <br>anticoagulant), ACL (anticardiolipin antibodies), anti-β2Glicoprotein I <br>(anty-β2GPI), anti-prothrombin antibodies (anti-PT). APLA IgM and IgG were <br>detected in serum twice in 6 months interval. Mean observational time was 14 <br>months. Results: APLA incidence in patients after liver transplantation is <br>higher than in general population and ranges from 0-18,75%. In three T(+) <br>patients an episode of thrombosis occurred during observation time <br>(thrombosis 2). Two patients developed HAT, but only in one with AIH in <br>native liver (retransplanted due to HAT complicated by biliary ischemia and <br>hepatic abscess in the first graft, with recurrence of early HAT after <br>retransplantation) ACL were detected in highly positive titer. In the second <br>patient on aspirin with no APLA, late, partial HAT appeared during treatment <br>with INF/RBV due to hepatitis C recurrence. The 3rd patient (AIH in native <br>liver) developed splenic artery thrombosis despite treatment with VKA (INR <br>2-3). No thrombotic events were observed in T(- ). There were statistically <br>significant difference in ACL IgM between T(-) and T(+) in examination 1 <br>(p=0,0194) and in examination 2 (p=0,0090). In patients with thrombosis 2 <br>liver graft function remained above upper normal limits (ASP 40,7+/-8,1, ALT <br>49,7+/-20). In the whole group liver graft function remained stable with no <br>significant difference in ASP/ALT activity between T(-) and T(+). <br>Discussion: ACL IgM and IgG, anty-β2GPI IgM and anty-PT IgG were detected in <br>highly positive titers in both examinations, what confirms a constant <br>production of APLA. Anti-β2GPI are representative for autoimmune diseases <br>and their IgM concentration detected in liver recipients was also higher <br>than in general population, but with no statistically significant difference <br>between T(-) and T(+). As a potential causes of not detecting APLA in two <br>T(+) patients with thrombosis 2, we consider immunosuppressive therapy, <br>spontaneous APLA elimination from the circulation or thrombosis was due to <br>surgical complication with no correlation with APLA. ACL was persistently <br>present only in one T(+) patient. All thrombotic events occurred during <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, what indicate that the strength of this treatment was <br>inadequate. Conclusion: Liver graft thrombosis has multifactorial etiology, <br>but APLA detection may be useful tool to determine the additional thrombotic <br>risk factor.

The incidence of thrombosis in the paediatric population is highest <br>in newborns, as about 10% of thrombotic events occur in the first four weeks <br>of life. Haemostasis in a newborn, though still developing, is a well <br>balanced mechanism. About 90% of all thrombotic events are due to acquired <br>and the rest to congenital risk factors. The aim of our study was to <br>estimate the incidence of thrombosis in a population of Slovenian newborns <br>and to study risk factors, location and treatment of thrombotic events. <br>Inpatient charts of newborns with thrombosis, admitted to a tertiary <br>neonatology centre and paediatric intensive care unit between 2004 and 2011, <br>were studied retrospectively.

Logistic regression was used to <br>investigate the clinic-laboratory parameters that were predictive for the <br>resolution of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Results: Among the 93 patients, the median age was 63 <br>years old (range 1-91), and 61 (66%) of the patients were male. Abdominal <br>pain was the most common symptom, occurring in the 53 patients (57%). <br>Twenty-nine (31%) patients were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. For <br>35 of the treated patients, <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> (71%), anti-platelet agents <br>(20%), and catheter-directed urokinase infusion (26%) were the common <br>modalities.

Bellile E. Hawley A.E. Anderson M.A. Wakefield T.W. Sood S.L.<br>Blood (2012) 120:21. Date of Publication: 16 Nov 2012<br><br>INTRODUCTION: VTE is common in patients with cancer and causes significant <br>morbidity and mortality. Clinical risk models and biomarkers including <br>C-reactive protein (CRP), soluble P-selectin (sPsel), and D-dimer have been <br>used to predict VTE in diverse groups of cancer patients at varying risk for <br>VTE. The applicability of these findings to specific high risk subtypes of <br>cancer has not been established. Therefore, we sought to identify the value <br>of clinical factors, plasma biomarkers, and risk models in predicting VTE in <br>patients with pancreatic cancer, a malignancy with a high predilection for <br>VTE. METHODS: Patients seen at the University of Michigan Comprehensive <br>Cancer Center (UMCCC) and previously consented and enrolled in a prospective <br>cohort study were eligible. Inclusion criteria are diagnosis of pancreatic <br>adenocarcinoma, evaluation at UMCCC, no VTE within a month prior to cancer <br>diagnosis, and documentation in the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) at least <br>every 6 months until death. Primary objective was to identify factors <br>predictive of VTE. Secondary objectives were to develop a VTE predictive <br>model, assess the utility of published VTE risk models, and evaluate factors <br>associated with overall survival (OS). Demographics, clinical data, and VTE <br>(deep vein thrombosis [DVT], <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> [<span style="color: red">PVT</span>], or pulmonary <br>embolism [PE]) rate were obtained from the EMR. ELISAs were performed for <br>CRP, D-dimer, Mac-2 binding protein, soluble E-selectin (sEsel), and sPsel <br>using banked plasma specimens drawn at diagnosis. A retrospective cohort <br>study was performed including univariate and multivariate regression <br>analysis. The utility of predictive models by Khorana, et al (Blood, 2008. <br>111:4902-4907), which includes cancer site, body mass index (BMI), <br>hemoglobin (Hb), platelet (plt) count, and white blood cell count, and the <br>expanded model by the Vienna Cancer and Thrombosis Study (CATS) (Blood, <br>2010. 116:5377-5382), which additionally includes sPsel and D-dimer, were <br>assessed. RESULTS: Between 2005 and 2011, 89 patients were eligible for <br>analysis. Median follow-up was 268 (18-2433) days. Twenty (22%) cases had a <br>VTE; 10 (50%) DVT, 2 (10%) PE, 4 (20%) <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, and 4 (20%) multiple VTEs. Mean <br>(SD) age was 63.4 (8.9) in cases and 65.3 (11.2) in controls. Women <br>accounted for 55% of cases and 48% of controls. Higher BMI (median 28.8 <br>[21.2-44.7] in cases vs. 25.4 [16.4-43.3] in controls, p=0.03) and lower plt <br>count (median 241 [145-323] in cases vs. 289 [97-648] in controls, p=0.001) <br>were associated with VTE on univariate analysis. On multivariate regression <br>analysis, lower plt count (β -0.01, SE 0.004) and lower Hb (β -0.43, SE <br>0.20) were predictive of VTE after adjusting for BMI, tumor location, and <br>treatment with surgery, chemotherapy or radiation (AUC 0.78). None of the <br>biomarkers were significantly associated with VTE on univariate analysis, <br>although there was a trend with D-dimer (p=0.09). The Khorana score was <br>determined in 85 patients; 48 were intermediate (2 points) and 37 high risk <br>(3 points) with VTE rates of 20.8% and 24.3%, respectively (p=0.70). The AUC <br>of this model was 0.63. The risk score from CATS was calculated for 84 <br>patients; 54 were intermediate (2 or 3 points), 17 high (4 points), and 13 <br>highest risk (5 points). VTE incidence was not different among these groups <br>and the AUC was 0.65. Factors associated with poor OS on univariate analysis <br>were: age (per 10-year increment) (HR [95% confidence interval], p-value) <br>(1.35 [1.07-1.71], 0.013), chronic kidney disease (5.67 [2.62-12.25], <br><0.0001), use of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> (3.14 [1.33-7.41], 0.009), stage III/IV vs. <br>I/II pancreas cancer (2.05 [1.27-3.32], 0.003), and INR (1.65 [1.04-2.63], <br>0.035); elevated Hb (0.87 [0.76-0.99], 0.041) and sEsel (0.46 [0.29-0.72], <br>0.0007) were protective. CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic cancer patients with higher <br>BMI, lower plt count, and lower Hb were more likely to develop VTE. Other <br>clinical variables and biomarkers did not add additional predictive <br>information. Elevated sEsel, important for neutrophil trafficking to sites <br>of inflammation, was found to be protective on survival analysis. The risk <br>models developed by Khorana, et al and CATS in a diverse group of patients <br>with cancer were not able to further differentiate VTE risk among this <br>already high risk group. Additional work is needed to determine which <br>patients with pancreatic cancer are at highest risk for VTE and who may <br>benefit most from thromboprophylaxis.<br><br>RECORD 445<br>Should anticoagulants be administered for <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> associated <br>with acute pancreatitis?<br>Park W.-S.

Although a well-organized <br>protocol for the treatment of venous thrombosis has not been established, <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy is commonly recommended. A 73-year-old man was <br>diagnosed with acute progressive <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> associated with <br>acute pancreatitis. After one month of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy, the patient <br>developed severe hematemesis. With endoscopy and an abdominal computed <br>tomography scan, hemorrhages in the pancreatic pseudocyst, which was <br>ruptured into the duodenal bulb, were confirmed. After conservative <br>treatment, the patient was stabilized. While the rupture of a pseudocyst <br>into the surrounding viscera is a well-known phenomenon, spontaneous rupture <br>into the duodenum is rare. Moreover, no reports of upper gastrointestinal <br>bleeding caused by pseudocyst rupture in patients under <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>therapy for venous thrombosis associated with acute pancreatitis have been <br>published.

Date of Publication: October 2012<br><br>Portal thrombosis (PT) in the absence of cirrhosis is often related to a <br>combination of local causes and general prothrombotic conditions. The <br>duration of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy has been recommended for 6 months taking <br>into account the thrombotic underlying conditions. In the absence of a <br>strong prothrombic risk factor, the indications for permanent <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> are still unclear. The aim of this study was to compare 2 <br>strategies of treatment: <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> withdrawal (AW) versus permanent <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> (PA). Patients and Methods: Retrospective controlled study <br>performed from 2007 to 2011 in consecutive pts with PT without cirrhosis. <br>Investigations for thrombotic risk factors were conducted and <br>myeloproliferative neoplasms and JAK2 mutation were ruled out. Abdominal CT <br>scan was planned at M1, M6 then annually or as required. In the two groups, <br>low molecular weight heparin was early initiated at diagnosis and shifted to <br>vitamin K antagonists targeting an INR 2 to 3. Treatment was withdrawn (AW) <br>or continued (PA) according to a multidisciplinary committee decision. End <br>points were the rates of recurrent thrombosis and hemorrhagic events. <br>Results: Fifty two pts (mean age 47.2±14 yrs) followed for a mean of 31±17 <br>months were enrolled. PT was extra-hepatic in 32%, segmental in 14% and <br>mixed in 54% of cases. Thirteen % of pts had no risk factor of deep vein <br>thrombosis, 57% had one and 29% had at least 2 risk factors. The most <br>prevalent risk factors were past medical history of vein thrombosis (50%), <br>inflammatory condition (44%) and oral contraceptive (31%). <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>therapy was continued in 32 pts (61% of cases) whereas the duration of <br>therapy was 8.9±3 months in AW group. AW and PA groups differed in terms of <br>circumstances of diagnosis (fortuitous in 60% vs 12.5% p=0.001), presence <br>factor II /V heterozygous mutation (5% vs 34%, p=0.01) and location of PT <br>(extrahepatic PT: 45% vs 81%, p=0.006). CT scan at M6 was available for 37 <br>pts (71%), recanalisation was obtained at similar rates in the 2 groups <br>(52.6% vs 55.6%, p=ns). Hemoglobin/platelet counts did not differ at any <br>time of analysis. An extension of the thrombus was more frequently detected <br>in the AW group at month 36 (p=0.01) whereas the cumulative rate of <br>hemorrhagic events and the rate of severe events were not different between <br>the two groups (17.6% vs 32% and 6 vs 10%, p=ns). Conclusion: <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy is efficient in the majority of pts with PT in the <br>absence of cirrhosis and myeloproliferative neoplasms. In this study, the <br>maintenance of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was not associated with an excess risk of <br>bleeding and prevented the risk of thrombosis extension at middle term.<br><br>RECORD 453<br>Pylephlebitis: A rare cause of intrabdominal sepsis<br>Bhatia A.

Date of <br>Publication: October 2012<br><br>Purpose: Intra-abdominal infections can be associated with a variety of <br>complications. We present an unusual case of an infection of the portal vein <br>(pylephlebitis). A 72 year-old Caucasian male with hypertension presented <br>with epigastric pain and fevers. Initial workup revealed leukocytosis (19 <br>K/μL) as well as mildly elevated bilirubin (1.9 mg/dL). CT scan revealed an <br>acute left<span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> as well as concern for a fluid collection <br>near the hilum of the liver, possibly consistent with a hepatic abscess. <br>Treatment was initiated with intravenous heparin as well as broad-spectrum <br>antibiotics. The patient subsequently developed hypotension requiring <br>pressor support, progressive renal failure, and atrial fibrillation <br>necessitating cardioversion. Blood cultures revealed gram negative <br>bacteremia with Veillonella species. The patient then improved with the <br>antibiotics and <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> over the next 48 hours. It was unclear <br>whether the hilar fluid collection represented a cystic hepatic lesion or a <br>hepatic abscess through direct extension of the pylephlebitis. Given the <br>patient's clinical improvement, drainage of this hilar lesion was not <br>attempted. The patient received 6 weeks of intravenous antibiotic therapy as <br>well as Coumadin therapy. At long-term follow-up, he had no further <br>symptoms. Repeat CT scan showed a small complex hepatic cyst, and <br>persistence of the left<span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. The plan was to continue at <br>least 6 months of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> and repeat imaging studies 6 months later. <br>Pylephlebitis, or septic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>, can complicate any <br>intra-abdominal infection including diverticulitis, appendicitis, biliary <br>process or even inflammatory bowel disease. It is rarely associated with an <br>underlying hypercoagulable condition. Given its significant mortality (up to <br>30% even with antibiotic therapy), pylephlebitis should be considered in any <br>patient that presents with fevers, abdominal pain, and jaundice. Early <br>intravenous antibiotic therapy remains the mainstay of treatment. The role <br>of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> is controversial, but appears to have a beneficial role <br>through improved vascular recanalization, which may result in improved <br>mortality.<br><br>RECORD 454<br>Hemostatic imbalance does not predict response to anticoagulant therapy in <br>cirrhosis patients with <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>)<br>Rodriguez-Castro K.I. Sartori M.T. Pizzuti D. Fadin M. Spiezia L. Simioni P. <br>Russo F.P. Burra P. Senzolo M.<br>Hepatology (2012) 56 SUPPL. 1 (924A). Date of Publication: October 2012<br><br>Aim: The purpose of this study was to assess hemostatic status in terms of <br>pro- and anti-coagulant factors, as well as thrombus, and patient <br>characteristics, as predictors of therapeutic efficacy of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> to <br>treat <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in cirrhotics. Patients and methods: A cohort of 43 cirrhosis <br>patients who were diagnosed with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and received <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy <br>with low molecular weight heparin were retrospectively evaluated. Nadroparin <br>95 IU/Kg was administered to all patients, with a 40% dose reduction in <br>patients with platelet count below 50.000x109/L. Estimation of interval <br>between appearance of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and start of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy was made, <br>along with determination of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> characteristics and extension. All patients <br>underwent screening for thrombophilia and dosing of plasmatic pro-and <br>anti-coagulation factors. Imbalance between pro- and anti-coagulant factors <br>was further evaluated using the ratio FactorVIII/ Protein C. Vessel <br>recanalization was evaluated monthly using abdominal ultrasound and every 3 <br>months by CT scan. Results: 31 patients were males and mean age was 58±11 <br>years. Etiology of liver disease was viral in 48.8% and alcoholrelated in <br>30.2% of cases. Partial <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was found in 34/43 patients, with extension into <br>superior mesenteric or splenic veins in 14/43. Upon starting of <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy, estimated interval from appearance of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was >6 <br>months in 32/43, and longer than 6 months in the remaining 11 cases. Genetic <br>thrombophilic mutations were found in 7 patients. Twenty-five patients <br>responded to anticoagulant therapy, obtaining repermeation of the portal <br>vein (16 achieved complete recanalization) after a mean time of 6±9.6 months <br>of therapy. No correlation was found between standard coagulation <br>parameters, plasmatic activity of factors VII, IX, XI, AT, PS, PC, <br>fibrinogen, or factor VIII/PC ratio, and thrombus disappearance. Likewise, <br>repermeation did not correlate with the extension of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, presence of <br>thrombophilic mutations, severity of liver disease, or etiology of <br>cirrhosis. An interval between development of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and start of <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy >6 months was the only significant predictor of <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> efficacy (75% versus 18%, p>.001) with no patients with <br>older thrombus achieving repermeation after 6 months of therapy. <br>Conclusions: the interval between <span style="color: red">PVT</span> occurrence and start of <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy is the only predictor of recanalization; on the <br>contrary, hemostatic imbalance does not correlate with anticoagulant <br>response. For patients with recent thrombus, continuation of anticoagulant <br>therapy beyond 6 months could increase the possibility of repermeation.<br><br>RECORD 455<br>Portal and mesenteric vein thrombosis in hereditary spherocytosis<br>Maheshwari N. Kulkarni S. Ikwueke I. Danve A. Anand S. Awasthi S. Kumari D. <br>Harley J.<br>American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012) 107 SUPPL. 1 (S443). Date of <br>Publication: October 2012<br><br>Introduction: Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is an inherited hemolytic <br>disorder and complications associated with HS include extra medullary <br>hematopoiesis, gallstones, aplastic crisis, leg ulcers but venous or <br>arterial thrombosis are uncommon. We report clinical and laboratory findings <br>of HS patient with portal and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis. Case <br>Report: 36-year-old male with history of HS, splenectomy at 5 years of age, <br>hypertension, hyperlipidemia admitted with complaints of peri umbilical <br>abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting for one day after eating cheeseburger. <br>Denies alcohol, smoking or drug abuse and was not on medications at home. <br>Review of systems was unremarkable except for above. On physical <br>examination, he was febrile of 101F, abdomen was soft , non-distended, <br>moderate to severe diffuse tenderness with prominence in epigastric and <br>periumbilical areas, no rebound tenderness and normal bowel sounds, rest of <br>examination was unremarkable. Laboratory findings were pertinent for <br>leukocytosis with left shift , mildly elevated creatine, normal lactate, <br>amylase and lipase. CAT scan of abdomen showed acute portal vein and <br>superior mesenteric vein thrombosis, wall edema of stomach (antrum, pylorus) <br>and duodenum. Hypercoaguable work up including antithrombin III, factor V, <br>factor V Leiden mutation, anti-phospholipids antibody panel, protein C and <br>S, serum homocysteine, coombs test, prothrombin gene mutation, <br>anticardiolipin antibodies, LDH, and haptoglobin were negative. Patient was <br>started on anti-coagulation and symptoms improved in 2-3 days with good oral <br>tolerance and discharged on oral <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> to followup in hematology <br>clinic. Discussion: There are few reported cases of arterial and venous <br>thromboembolic events in splencetomized HS patients. These vascular events <br>involve brain, lungs, and to our knowledge, only a few cases of portal and <br>superior mesenteric vein thrombosis have been reported. First case of HS and <br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> was of a 39-year-old male with HS and splenectomy who <br>developed hematemesis and portal and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis. <br>The precise mechanism underlying hypercoaguable state in patients with HS is <br>not fully understood yet though a few suggested mechanisms have been <br>described like accelerated lipid loss with increased substrate for <br>procoagulant activation and platelet activation causing transfer of anionic <br>phospholipids from inner to the outer membrane accelerating coagulation <br>process. Physicians should keep this rare complication in differential <br>diagnosis for HS patients presenting with abdominal pain and prompt <br>diagnosis may prevent further clinical deterioration.<br><br>RECORD 456<br>Predictive factors of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) in cirrhotic patients: <br>Importance of non-invasive measurement of splanchnic blood flow with MRI<br>Sogni P.

Date of Publication: October 2012<br><br>Background: A non-tumoral <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in cirrhotic patients worsens the prognosis. <br>It's important to determine predictive factors, in the setting of future <br>preventive <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> studies. The aim of this study was the <br>identification of predictive factors of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> with a focus on splanchnic and <br>systemic blood flow measurement with MRI which is a non-invasive and a <br>non-operator dependent method. Patients and Methods: All cirrhotic patients <br>with non-invasive MRI validated measurement of blood flows (1) were <br>included. Initial clinical, biological and endoscopic data were collected <br>and the follow-up was performed with ultrasound every 6 months or earlier if <br>a complication occurred, until the diagnosis of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> (complete or partial) or <br>the end of follow- up, death or transplantation. Patients with tumoral <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>were excluded. Results: Forty-seven cirrhotic patients (58±2 years; 72% <br>male; 18 alcohol, 16 HCV and 13 associated or others) with an initial MRI <br>measurement of portal vein, azygos and abdominal aortic blood flows were <br>prospectively included. At the inclusion, 13, 21 and 12 patients were <br>Child-Pugh A, B and C respectively, 60% with an ascites, 9% with an hepatic <br>encephalopathy and 28 % received beta-blockers. Esophageal varices were of <br>grade 0-1 in 21 patients and grade 2-3 in 26. During the follow-up (17.7±1.7 <br>months), a <span style="color: red">PVT</span> occurred in 10 patients with a delay of 21.3±4.3 months. In <br>univariate analysis, the only initial factor associated with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was the <br>Child- Pugh score (p=0.047). Factors associated with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in univariate <br>analysis with p<0.20 were included in multivariate analysis (Child-Pugh, <br>ascites, portal flux direction, portal blood flow and azygos blood flow). <br>The 2 independent and initial factors associated with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> were azygos blood <br>flow p=0.015) and ascites (p=0.043). Conclusion: The presence of ascites and <br>a low speed azygos blood flow were the 2 independent and initial factors <br>associated with the occurrence of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in cirrhotic patients. In the future <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> studies for the prevention of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in cirrhotic patients, <br>non-invasive measurement of blood flows, especially for the azygos vein, <br>could be of interest for selecting at risk population.<br><br>RECORD 457<br>Colonic endometriosis: A case of chronic abdominal pain<br>Horsley-Silva J.

Date <br>of Publication: October 2012<br><br>Purpose: A 43-year-old white female presented to clinic for further <br>evaluation of two years of abdominal pain mostly on the left side, dull, <br>sometimes sharp, worsening after eating, improving after bowel movements and <br>no associated bloody stools. Patient had a history of deep venous thrombosis <br>and pulmonary embolism three years prior treated with coumadin for one year. <br>A few months prior to presentation patient had acute right upper quadrant <br>pain leading to computer tomography (CT) of the abdomen demonstrating portal <br>vein thrombosis and superior mesenteric vein (SMV) thrombosis causing <br>treatment initiation with coumadin again. Patient underwent evaluation for <br>thrombophilia disorders and malignancy resulting in a colonoscopy, which <br>revealed a nonbleeding mucosal ulceration in the proximal ascending colon <br>and initial biopsy consistent with chronic inflammation. Repeat colonoscopy <br>one month later demonstrated a persistent ulcer in the mid-ascending colon <br>with biopsies revealing endometriosis. Patient's gynecologic history <br>involved two previous gestations, a caesarean section, uterine fibroids and <br>hysterectomy many years prior. No history of endometriosis. Further <br>evaluation at our hospital involved CT enterography demonstrating a <br>nonocclusive thrombus in the SMV and occlusive thrombus in the right <br>ileocolic branch. Colonoscopy showed granularity and nodularity in the <br>ascending colon without ulceration, and biopsy revealed colonic mucosa with <br>associated inflammation with stroma and focal glands suggestive of <br>endometriosis. Patient underwent evaluation by vascular surgery concluding <br>no surgery was necessary since adequate vessels were present to supply gut <br>through collaterals. Hematology evaluation revealed a negative complete <br>coagulation survey. Gynecology desired to pursue a trial with lupron <br>(leuprolide) injections.

We <br>herein report a protein S-deficient patient presenting with acute <br>portomesenteric venous thrombosis. Early management using anticoagulant <br>therapy was initially successful. However, the subsequent bowel stricture <br>resulting from the ischemic insult was further managed with a surgical <br>bypass. The patient was kept on long-term thrombophylaxis. The treatment <br>strategy for MVT with bowel ischemia has evolved from aggressive <br>portomesenteric thrombectomy with resection of the involved bowel, to <br>conservative <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> to recanalize thrombotic mesenteric veins with <br>bowel preservation.

Kijsirichareanchai K. Mankongpaisarnrung C. Rakvit A.<br>American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012) 107 SUPPL. 1 (S401). Date of <br>Publication: October 2012<br><br>Purpose: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) and systemic venous thromboembolism <br>are significantly increased in cirrhotic patients even without <br>hepatocellular carcinoma. The risk of developing such complications is <br>usually associated with advanced cirrhosis. When cirrhosis is mild and <br>compensated, other possible causes of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> should also be considered. We <br>present a case of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in chronic hepatitis C infection with focal cirrhosis <br>and portal hypertension with history of splenectomy. A 47-year-old Caucasian <br>woman presented with chronic hepatitis C, genotype 1. She was treated with <br>pegylated interferon and ribavirin for 48 weeks, but developed viral <br>relapse. She had splenectomy when she was young for unclear reason. Her <br>findings on pathologic examination of the liver biopsy were consistent with <br>focal cirrhosis in mild to moderate chronic hepatitis; the Knodell's <br>histologic activity index (HAI) score was 7-9/22. Her MELD score was 6. An <br>annual esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed non-bleeding grade II esophageal <br>varices and cardial gastric varices. A computerized tomography scan revealed <br>the sub-occlusive thrombus at the bifurcation of the main portal vein. The <br>workup for hypercoagulable state showed low protein C, protein S, and <br>antithrombin III levels. The inferior vena caval venogram showed thrombotic <br>occlusion in left , right, and common portal vein with a portal systemic <br>pressure gradient of 11 mmHg. Collateralization was present at portal <br>hiatus. The ultrasound guided thrombus removal with interventional <br>thrombolysis was attempted in order to avoid systemic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>therapy. However, the guidewire failed to pass through the obstructed portal <br>vein. She eventually was evaluated for liver transplantation. This is a case <br>that demonstrates the presence of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in a patient with mild compensated <br>cirrhosis (based on both histological and clinical evaluation) without <br>hepatocellular carcinoma. The incidence of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in well-compensated cirrhosis <br>is reported between 0.6-16%. An increased frequency is reported in <br>decompensated cirrhosis and in up to 35% of cirrhotic patients with <br>hepatocellular carcinoma. The origin of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is multifactorial in most <br>cirrhotic patients. Low serum protein C, protein S, and antithrombin III <br>level secondary to decreased protein synthesis in cirrhosis can contribute <br>to a prothrombotic state. Splenectomy is another possible cause of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in <br>this case, since <span style="color: red">PVT</span> after splenectomy occurs in 6-8%. However, the late <br>onset of presentation makes it a less likely cause since most <span style="color: red">PVT</span> occurs in <br>days to weeks after splenectomy.<br><br>RECORD 463<br>Splanchnic vein thrombosis<br>Riva N.

Date of Publication: 2012<br><br>Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) - including mesenteric, portal, splenic and <br>supra-hepatic veins thrombosis - is an underdiagnosed disease, with <br>heterogeneous clinical presentations and a non-negligible rate of incidental <br>findings. The main risk factors include abdominal diseases or interventions <br>(e.g. infections, cirrhosis, abdominal cancer or surgical procedures), <br>haematological disorders (mainly myeloproliferative neoplasms), inherited <br>thrombophilic states and hormonal imbalances. New biological markers of <br>subclinical disorders have recently been identified: JAK2 mutation and flow <br>cytometry for CD55 and CD59. Clinical manifestations are generally <br>aspecific. During the acute phase, main symptoms can be abdominal pain, <br>gastrointestinal bleeding and ascites; while long-term consequences include <br><span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> and portal hypertension. Advances in non-invasive vascular <br>imaging (Doppler ultrasound, angio-computed tomography and magnetic <br>resonance imaging), have improved the diagnosis of SVT. Alterations in blood <br>tests may suggest an underlying haematological or hepatic disorder.The <br>optimal treatment of SVT remains an open issue, since large clinical trials <br>are lacking. Expert consensus recommend to treat acute symptomatic <br>non-cirrhotic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> with parenteral <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> during <br>the acute phase, followed by oral anticoagulants for at least 3 months, <br>though lifelong treatment is recommended in case of persistent prothrombotic <br>factors. In Budd-Chiari syndrome, <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> is recommended for all <br>patients in the absence of major contraindications. However, the risk to <br>benefit-ratio of anticoagulant therapy, both in the acute phase and for the <br>long-term secondary prevention, still needs to be better assessed. © <br>Schattauer 2012.<br><br>RECORD 464<br>How to manage portal vein stenosis<br>Vidal V. Gaubert J.-Y.<br>CardioVascular and Interventional Radiology (2012) 35 SUPPL. 1 (S133). Date <br>of Publication: September 2012<br><br>Learning Objectives 1. To present an update of recent trials and <br>meta-analysis 2. To describe the indications, techniques and devices for <br>recanalizing portal and mesenteric vein occlusion 3. To describe the <br>techniques of thrombectomy and thrombolysis <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) <br>leads to complications of portal hypertension which causes bleeding through <br>varices. Eight to 20% are idiopathic, in adults. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is associated with <br>cirrhosis and its incidence increases as the disease progresses. The <br>prevalence in patients with cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma is as high as 44%. <br>The other causes are neoplasm, coagulation disorders and inflammatory- <br>infectious abdominal causes (1). The acute and chronic forms of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> are <br>differentiated by the length of time over which they develop. In acute <br>stage, symptoms are generally nonspecific. If the thrombus extends as far as <br>the distal mesenteric branches, it may cause ischemia or infarction of the <br>mesenteric vein which leads to abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and ascites. <br>The existence of peritoneal irritation and ascites indicates necrosis of the <br>wall and perforation. In these cases, surgery is required with 13 to 50% <br>mortality reported. In the chronic form, symptoms are usually due to portal <br>hypertension, principally bleeding through varices (2). Imaging techniques <br>are essential for the diagnosis of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> because the clinical manifestations <br>are minor and unspecific. Four anatomic categories related to the extent of <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span> have been defined and have clinical relevance for both prognosis and <br>treatment: grade I, thrombus limited to the portal vein, grade II, thrombus <br>extending to the superior mesenteric vein, grade III, thrombus spreading <br>diffusely through the splanchnic venous system but with the presence of <br>large collaterals, grade IV, as grade III but without collaterals. The first <br>approach for treating acute <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is to start <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> with heparin at <br>once. The aim is to maintain the activated partial thromboplastin time <br>(aPTT) at twice its normal level. Once the thrombosis is resolved, heparin <br>is replaced by oral anticoagulants for 6 months. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> alone <br>results in resolution of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in up to 80% of cases. In chronic forms of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> is more controversial, because portosystemic variceal <br>collaterals have developed, which confer a greater risk of bleeding. <br>Selective administration of local fibrinolysis ensures that a high <br>concentration of fibrinolytic is present in the portomesenteric venous <br>system with lower systemic concentration. Local fibrinolysis can be <br>performed through the superior mesenteric artery or directly through the <br>portal vein via a transhepatic or transjugular route. Fibrinolysis through <br>the SMA seems to be more effective to reach the distal branches of the <br>mesenteric veins. In general, transhepatic approach is the most frequently <br>used. It is easier than transjugular approach but has a greater risk of <br>bleeding. The thrombus is recanalized with guide wires and a multiperforated <br>catheter is inserted to perfuse urokinase or rtPA. Pharmacologic <br>thrombolysis is an effective technique for treating acute <span style="color: red">PVT</span> but severe <br>hemorrhagic complications occurred in more than 30% of cases, so it is <br>recommend to use this technique for severe cases. The efficacy of <br>thrombolysis is related to the time over which the thrombus has developed. <br>The best results are obtained when the thrombus is less than 14 days. Only <br>very slight response can be expected after 40 days. The main complications <br>of local fibrinolytic treatment are related to transhepatic puncture, which <br>may cause intra-peritoneal bleeding (3). Mechanical percutaneous <br>thrombectomy is performed usually in conjunction with other treatments as <br>local fibrinolysis or balloon dilatation and stent placement. Balloon <br>dilatation with stent placement is the technique of choice for dealing with <br>residual thrombosis with stenosis or tumor invasion or local inflammatory <br>processes. Mechanical recanalization devices can be divided into devices <br>that perform thrombectomy by direct contact (angioplasty balloon, fixed or <br>rotating wire baskets and pigtail catheters), hydrodynamic thrombectomy <br>devices and rheolytic thrombectomy devices (based on flow). It is also <br>useful to try to remove part of the thrombus by aspiration. Balloons used <br>ranged usually from 8 to 10 mm diameter and stent is self-expandable. When <br>mechanical thrombectomy devices are used, there is a potential risk of <br>damaging the vessel, which may predispose to rethrombosis. Although the <br>presence of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is regarded as a relative contraindication to TIPS, it can <br>be very useful in cirrhotic patient with portal hypertension. TIPS in these <br>cases need to be inserted by an experimented team.<br><br>RECORD 465<br>Radiological reporting of incidental <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> - Do we aid <br>clinical management?<br>Gopalan P.

Underlying causes included 34% malignancy, 30% cirrhosis and 36% sepsis <br>of which 51% due to biliary and pancreatic cause. A third of reports <br>mentioned acute/chronic nature. 72% thrombus located within main portal <br>vein, 24% branch vessels, 11% SMV and 4.7% within splenic vein. 36% <br>suspected acute thrombosis in relation to previous imaging, half were <br>anticoagulated with variable benefits.

Patients and Methods We <br>designed a prospective randomized trial of anticoagulant therapy in advanced <br>cirrhotic patients with the following end-points: primary, evaluation of <br>efficacy in preventing <span style="color: red">PVT</span>; secondary, assessment of safety, prevention of <br>decompensation and/or survival (ISRCTN32383354, Eudract 2007-007890-22). <br>Cirrhotic patients, Child B7-C10, were randomized to receive enoxaparin 4000 <br>IU/die or placebo for 12 months followed by 12 months observation. Doppler <br>US was performed every three months and CT every six months to check for <br>portal vein axis. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was considered as relevant when complete or involving <br>more than 50% of PV diameter and symptomatic. We report the events of the 70 <br>enrolled patients (34 randomized to treatment and 36 to placebo) at <br>completion of the 24 months study. Results No major bleeding was reported in <br>the treatment arm. Only one patient was withdrawn from active arm because of <br>thrombocytopenia (<10.000/mmc). During the 1-year study period, <span style="color: red">PVT</span> (3 <br>complete, 3 partial) occurred in 6 of 36 (16.7%) patients on placebo and in <br>none on enoxaparin (p=0.023 χ2).

Technical <br>improvements and increased experience over the past 24 years led to improved <br>clinical results and a better definition of the indications for TIPS. <br>Randomized clinical trials indicate that the TIPS procedure is not a <br>first-line therapy for variceal bleeding, but can be used when medical <br>treatment fails, both in the acute situation or to prevent variceal <br>rebleeding.

However, due to the absence of strong evidence, no <br>standard treatment algorithm for the secondary prophylaxis of variceal <br>bleeding in cirrhotic patients with non-tumoral <span style="color: red">PVT</span> has been established. <br>Previous randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that transjugular <br>intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) can significantly decrease the <br>incidence of variceal rebleeding in cirrhotic patients without <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, compared <br>with conservative therapy (i.e., endoscopic plus pharmacological therapy). <br>Further, several large cohort studies have confirmed that TIPS can <br>effectively prevent variceal rebleeding in cirrhotic patients with <br>non-tumoral <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. On the other hand, TIPS can facilitate recanalizing the <br>thrombosed portal vein by endovascular manipulations, even in the presence <br>of cavernous transformation of the portal vein (CTPV).

We herein review the current knowledge on that topic in order <br>to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of the currently proposed <br>therapeutic attitudes in face of the diagnosis of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in individuals with <br>cirrhosis. © Copyright 2012 Genevive Huard and Marc Bilodeau.<br><br>RECORD 472<br>Impact of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> on outcomes in non-malignant and non-cirrhotic <br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>: A retrospective observational study<br>Hall T. Bilku D. Metcalfe M. Rajesh A. Dennison A. Garcea G.<br>HPB (2012) 14 SUPPL. 2 (548). Date of Publication: July 2012<br><br>Introduction: No definitive evidence exists regarding the treatment of acute <br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>). The natural history is also poorly understood. <br>Treatment modalities described include conservative management, <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, thrombolysis and thrombectomy. This observational study <br>examines the impact of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> on <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Methods: The electronic <br>radiology database was searched with keywords 'portal vein' and <br>'thrombosis'. Relevant patient notes and imaging were reviewed to collect <br>data from those with acute <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. The primary end point was portal vein <br>recanalisation. Secondary outcome measures were morbidity and the <br>development of portal hypertension and its sequelae (including variceal <br>bleeding). Data from patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in the context of cirrhosis, <br>malignancy or liver transplant were excluded. Results: Twenty two patients <br>were included in the study. 45.5% were male and median age was 58.5 years <br>(range 30-89). Acute pancreatitis was implicated as the precipitating cause <br>in 50% of patients. 41.0% of patients were treated with <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. The <br>remainder received no intervention. Partial or complete recanalisation of <br>the portal vein occurred in 81.8% of anticoagulated patients and 37.5% of <br>the non-treatment group. 5 patients died, 1 was secondary to an intracranial <br>haemorrhage whilst anticoagulated and another who was not treated secondary <br>developed small bowel ischaemia and peritonitis. The remaining 3 died from <br>the underlying pathology. Conclusion: Spontaneous resolution of acute portal <br>vein thrombosis is uncommon. Early <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> results in a higher rate <br>of recanalisation with minimal associated morbidity when compared with no <br>treatment.<br><br>RECORD 473<br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>, cirrhosis, and liver transplantation<br>Francoz C. Valla D. Durand F.<br>Journal of Hepatology (2012) 57:1 (203-212). Date of Publication: July 2012<br><br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> is not uncommon in candidates for transplantation. <br>Partial thrombosis is more common than complete thrombosis. Despite careful <br>screening at evaluation, a number of patients are still found with <br>previously unrecognized thrombosis per-operatively. The objective is to <br>recanalize the portal vein or, if recanalization is not achievable, to <br>prevent the extension of the thrombus so that a splanchnic vein can be used <br>as the inflow vessel to restore physiological blood flow to the allograft. <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> during waiting time and transjugular intrahepatic <br>portosystemic shunt (TIPS) are two options to achieve these goals. TIPS may <br>achieve recanalization in patients with complete <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. <br>However, a marked impairment in liver function, which is a characteristic <br>feature of most candidates for transplantation, may be a contraindication <br>for TIPS. Importantly, the MELD score is artificially increased by the <br>administration of vitamin K antagonists due to prolonged INR. When patency <br>of the portal vein and/or superior mesenteric vein is not achieved, only <br>non-anatomical techniques (renoportal anastomosis or cavoportal <br>hemitransposition) can be performed. These techniques, which do not fully <br>reverse portal hypertension, are associated with higher morbidity and <br>mortality risks. Multivisceral transplantation including the liver and small <br>bowel needs to be evaluated. In the absence of prothrombotic states that may <br>persist after transplantation, there is no evidence that pre-transplant <br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> justifies long term <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>post-transplantation, provided portal flow has been restored through <br>conventional end-to-end portal anastomosis. © 2012 European Association for <br>the Study of the Liver.

Date of <br>Publication: July 2012<br><br>Background & Aims: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is a frequent event in <br>patients with cirrhosis; it can be treated with anticoagulants, but there <br>are limited data regarding safety and efficacy of this approach. We <br>evaluated this therapy in a large series of patients with cirrhosis and <br>non-neoplastic <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Methods: We analyzed data from 55 patients with <br>cirrhosis and <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, diagnosed from June 2003 to September 2010, who received <br>anticoagulant therapy for acute or subacute thrombosis (n = 31) or <br>progression of previously known <span style="color: red">PVT</span> (n = 24). Patients with cavernomatous <br>transformation were excluded. Thrombosis was diagnosed, and recanalization <br>was evaluated by using Doppler ultrasound, angio-computed tomography, and/or <br>angio-magnetic resonance imaging analyses. Results: Partial or complete <br>recanalization was achieved in 33 patients (60%; complete in 25). Early <br>initiation of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was the only factor significantly associated <br>with recanalization. Rethrombosis after complete recanalization occurred in <br>38.5% of patients after <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy was stopped. Despite similar <br>baseline characteristics, patients who achieved recanalization developed <br>less frequent liver-related events (portal hypertension-related bleeding, <br>ascites, or hepatic encephalopathy) during the follow-up period, but this <br>difference was not statistically significant (P = .1). Five patients <br>developed bleeding complications that were probably related to <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. A platelet count <50 × 109/L was the only factor <br>significantly associated with higher risk for experiencing a bleeding <br>complication. There were no deaths related to <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy. <br>Conclusions: <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> is a relatively safe treatment that leads to <br>partial or complete recanalization of the portal venous axis in 60% of <br>patients with cirrhosis and <span style="color: red">PVT</span>; it should be maintained indefinitely to <br>prevent rethrombosis. © 2012 AGA Institute.<br><br>RECORD 476<br>Increased platelet activation in cirrhosis via oxidative stress<br>Celikbilek M.

Date of Publication: July 2012<br><br>Background: There is no established management algorithm for portal vein <br>thrombosis (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) in cirrhotic patients. The aim of our study was to <br>prospectively evaluate <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> and transjugular intrahepatic <br>portosystemic shunt (TIPS) to treat <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Methods: Cirrhotics with <br>non-malignant <span style="color: red">PVT</span> were included. Low weight molecular heparin <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was considered in all; TIPS was indicated if thrombosis <br>progressed or <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was contraindicated. Patients who were not <br>anticoagulated nor received TIPS served as controls. Results: Fifty-six <br>patients (of whom 21 controls) were included. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was occlusive in 11/35, <br>with extension to the superior mesenteric or splenic vein in 13/35. In the <br>study group 33 patients were anticoagulated, with a recanalization rate of <br>36% (12/33) compared with 1/21 among controls. A time interval between <br>appearance of thrombosis and <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> < 6 months predicted chance of <br>repermeation. Thrombus progression occurred in 15/21 non anticoagulated <br>patients and in 5/33 anticoagulated patients (P < 0.001). TIPS was placed in <br>six patients. There were five variceal bleedings and two intestinal venous <br>ischaemia episodes in the control group, compared with one variceal bleeding <br>episode in the study group. Conclusions: In cirrhotics with <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, a treatment <br>algorithm using <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> and TIPS achieves a good chance of complete <br>repermeation, reduces portal hypertensive complications, and decreases the <br>rate of thrombosis progression. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.<br><br>RECORD 478<br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy prevents portal-splenic vein thrombosis after <br>splenectomy with gastroesophageal devascularization<br>Lai W.

Date of <br>Publication: July2012<br><br>AIM: To compare the incidence of early portal or splenic vein thrombosis <br>(PSVT) in patients treated with irregular and regular anticoagulantion after <br>splenectomy with gastroesophageal devascularization.METHODS: We <br>retrospectively analyzed 301 patients who underwent splenectomy with <br>gastroesophageal devascularization for portal hypertension due to cirrhosis <br>between April 2004 and July 2010. Patients were categorized into group A <br>with irregular <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> and group B with regular <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, <br>respectively. Group A (153 patients) received anticoagulant mono-therapy for <br>an undesignated time period or with aspirin or warfarin without <br>low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) irregularly. Group B (148 patients) <br>received subcutaneous injection of LMWH routinely within the first 5 d after <br>surgery, followed by oral warfarin and aspirin for one month regularly. The <br>target prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) was <br>1.25-1.50. Platelet and PT/INR were monitored. Color Doppler imaging was <br>performed to monitor PSVT as well as the effectiveness of thrombolytic <br>therapy. RESULTS: The patients' data were collected and analyzed <br>retrospectively. Among the patients, 94 developed early postoperative mural <br>PSVT, including 63 patients in group A (63/153, 41.17%) and 31 patients in <br>group B (31/148, 20.94%). There were 50 (32.67%) patients in group A and 27 <br>(18.24%) in group B with mural PSVT in the main trunk of portal vein. After <br>the administration of thrombolytic, anticoagulant and anti-aggregation <br>therapy, complete or partial thrombus dissolution achieved in 50 (79.37%) in <br>group A and 26 (83.87%) in group B.CONCLUSION: Regular <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>therapy can reduce the incidence of PSVT in patients who undergo splenectomy <br>with gastroesophageal devascularization, and regular anticoagulant therapy <br>is safer and more effective than irregular anticoagulant therapy. Early and <br>timely thrombolytic therapy is imperative and feasible for the prevention of <br>PSVT. © 2012 Baishideng.

Methods: During a period of 8 years, 47 patients with <br>acute extensive thrombosis of portal vein (PV) and superior mesenteric veins <br>(SMV) received urokinase infusion therapy by transcatheter selective SMA via <br>radial artery. Their mean age was 44±13 years (range: 19-65). Through radial <br>sheath, a 5F catheter was placed into SMA and subsequently the infusion of <br>urokinase was given for 5-11 days (mean: 7.1±2.5). Adequate <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>was initiated during treatment, throughout hospitalization and <br>post-discharge. Follow-up contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) was <br>performed in each patient every 3 days and before the removal of infusion <br>catheter. Termination of urokinase infusion therapy was decided on the basis <br>of clinical and radiographic findings. Results: Technical success was <br>achieved in all patients. Two patients had worsening abdominal pain, <br>developed the signs of peritonitis at 24 hours after interventional <br>treatment and underwent eventual laparotomy with the resection of necrotic <br>bowel. Substantial clinical improvement was observed in 45 (95.7%) of them <br>after the procedure. Minor complications at the radial puncture site were <br>observed in 7 patients (14.9%) and infusion therapy continued. Follow-up CT <br>scans at pre-discharge demonstrated a nearly complete disappearance of <br>PV-SMV thrombosis in 29 patients (64.4%) and partial recanalization of <br>PV-SMV thrombosis in 16 patients(35.6%).

Methods: This prospective <br>study included 10 patients with a recent portal thrombosis and 20 controls <br>(10 cirrhosis patients and 10 healthy subjects, all without thrombosis). The <br>diagnosis of thrombosis was based on clinical and ultrasound findings. <br>Pre-<span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> intra-thrombus enhancement on the contrast-enhanced <br>sonogram was examined with respect to the post<span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> results or <br>portal enhancement in controls.

However, in <br>4 other patients who had a thrombosis showing positive enhancement <br>concurrent with one showing negative enhancement, <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>recanalized the former and failed to recanalize the latter. Mean onset time <br>of contrast enhancement measured from the beginning of hepatic arterial <br>enhancement was significantly longer in the thrombus (6.6 ± 4.3 s, 3-16 s) <br>than in the portal vein of controls (cirrhosis, 4.3 ± 1.4 s, 2-8 s, P = <br>0.0035; healthy subjects, 2.4 ± 0.6 s, 1-3 s, P < 0.0001). <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>failed to achieve recanalization in 2 patients with negative intra-thrombus <br>enhancement.

Materials and methods: This prospective study included 23 <br>consecutive cirrhosis patients (63.8 ± 11.8 years old, 12 males and 11 <br>females) with emergency admission for acute variceal bleeding with or <br>without portal vein thrombus. Eligibility for <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> treatment was <br>determined by positive intra-thrombus enhancement on contrast <br>ultrasonography (perflubutane microbubble agent, 0.0075 mL/kg) performed <br>before endoscopy. Low-molecular-weight heparin was administered after <br>hemostasis was achieved by band ligation. Repeated band ligation or <br>injection sclerotherapy combined with argon plasma coagulation was performed <br>for variceal disappearance. Results: Hemostasis was achieved in all 10 <br>patients with active bleeding. Five of these patients had portal vein <br>thrombus, and all showed positive intra-thrombus enhancement on contrast <br>ultrasonography. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> treatment of these five patients resulted <br>in complete recanalization of the portal vein within 2-11 days. There were <br>no significant differences in the number of endoscopic treatment sessions or <br>the length of hospital stay between the groups with and without thrombosis, <br>and no complications including rebleeding were reported. Long term, none of <br>the patients who continued oral <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> treatment had recurrence of <br>thrombosis (4/5).

In July 2004, a 36-year-old woman in her second pregnancy presented <br>with isolated low platelet count (37x109/L). Routine diagnostic work-up was <br>unremarkable include ing tests recommended to detect causes of secondary <br>thrombocytopenia. LDH level was between 1 and 1.5 ULN, a potential clue to <br>an early diagnostic workup to exclude PNH Bone marrow aspiration was normal <br>and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura was diagnosed. Despite treatment <br>with high-dose steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin and cyclosporin A her <br>platelet count did not improve. At term, a Caesarean section was performed <br>along with a splenectomy. Following a massive post-partum hemorrhage <br>requiring packed RBC transfusions the patient was discharged in September <br>2004 with Hb 11.6 g/dL, but still low platelets (35x109/L ). Two years later <br>the patient was hospitalized in the department of neurology of another <br>hospital after experiencing drowsiness, headache and transient aphasia. <br>Cerebral CT scan revealed thrombosis of the sagittal sinus, moreover hepatic <br>enlargement, ascites, due to Budd Chiari syndrome ,along with asymptomatic <br>PE were detected and warfarin treatment initiated. The patient was diagnosed <br>with thrombophilia of unknown origin. Platelet count ranged between 50 and <br>100x109/L. During follow-up, a series of diagnostic tests, including bone <br>marrow biopsy (cellularity 15%), tumor markers and markers of congenital and <br>acquired thrombophilia were performed. PNH was diagnosed by flow cytometry <br>(99% GPI-linked CD14 and CD55 defect). The patient developed hepatic vein <br>thrombosis in 2007 and was hospitalized again in January 2009 with <br>persistent abdominal pain while on warfarin and with INR within the <br>therapeutic range. D-dimer level was 5290 ng/ml and LDH 2N , Abdominal <br>Doppler US revealed massive <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> with cavernoma of the <br>liver. Eculizumab therapy was started in June 2009, as recommended in <br>patients with recurrent abdominal and cerebral thromboses (Brodsky, Blood <br>2011), and because oral warfarin had proven ineffective. The subsequent <br>clinical course was unremarkable with no further reports of abdominal pain, <br>or TE and normalization of all hematological values (LDH: 159-364 IU/L; Hb: <br>12.6 g/dL; platelets: 231,000/mm3). D-dimer level range between N and <br>2N.Conclusions: We suggest that in patients who have a history of <br>potentially devastating recurrent venous thrombosis eculizumab treatment <br>must be considered, even when haemolysis is not serious enough to require <br>blood transfusion. In this particular patient, who had experienced at least <br>3 major thrombotic events over a 5 year period, there has been no recurrence <br>since eculizumab was started over 2 years ago.<br><br>RECORD 485<br>Pylephlebitis and acute mesenteric ischemia in a young man with inherited <br>thrombophilia and suspected foodborne illness<br>Pradka S.P.

Date of Publication: <br>June 2012<br><br>Background: Mesenteric vein thrombosis (MVT) is a rare and frequently <br>underdiagnosed complicationof Crohn's disease (CD). This study describes the <br>clinical and radiological characteristics of CD /patients with superior <br>mesenteric vein thrombosis (MVT) diagnosed by CT/MRI. Patients and methods: <br>The database of Crohn's disease patients treated in Sheba Medical Center <br>between 2005-2010 was searched for MVT diagnosis. Imaging studies of <br>identified patients were retrieved and reviewed by an experienced abdominal <br>radiologist. MVT was defined by superior mesenteric vein obliteration and/or <br>thrombus in the vessel lumen on abdominal imaging. The clinical and <br>radiologic data of these patients were collected from the medical records. <br>Results: MVT was demonstrated in 6/460 CD patients. Five patients had <br>stricturing disease, and one patient had a combined fistulizing and <br>stricturing disease phenotype. All patients had small bowel disease, but 3/6 <br>also had colonic involvement. No patient had a prior thromboembolic history <br>or demonstrable hypercoagulability. One patient had an acute SMV thrombus <br>demonstrable on CT scanning, the remaining patients showed an obliteration <br>of superior mesenteric vein. Two patients received <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> upon <br>diagnosis of thrombosis. No subsequent thromboembolic events were recorded. <br>Conclusions: The incidence of mesenteric vein thrombosis is likely to be <br>underestimated in patients with Crohn's disease. Both CT and MRI imaging <br>demonstrate the extent of enteric disease and coincident SMV thrombosis. In <br>our cohort, thrombosis was associated with stricturing disease of the small <br>bowel. The clinical impact of SMV thrombosis and whether <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> is <br>mandatory for all of these patients remains to be determined. © 2011 <br>European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation.<br><br>RECORD 489<br>Is long term <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> needed to prevent rethrombosis following LT in <br>cirrhotic patients who had <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> prior to LT?<br>Francoz C.

Date of Publication: May <br>2012<br><br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is not uncommon in cirrhosis as it is found in <br>about 15% of candidates for LT. Several reports suggest that preLT <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> may help to perform anatomic portal anastomoses. In those <br>patients, there is a potential risk of rethrombosis. In the early post <br>operative period, recurrence of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> generally leads to graft failure. In <br>contrast, delayed thrombosis does not lead to graft failure but results in <br>portal hypertension. Theoretically, post LT <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> may prevent the <br>recurrence of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, however the risk of rethrombosis, without <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, has never been investigated. The aim of this study was to <br>assess the risk of rethrombosis after LT in a cohort of patients who had <br>preLT <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. We retrospectively studied 91 patients who had pretransplant <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>and were transplanted between 1990 and 2011 in a single institution.Patients <br>with myeloproliferative disorders or antiphospholipid syndrome were <br>excluded. Until 2001, patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> did not receive <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. <br>After 2001, based on the good results of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in non cirrhotic <br>population with <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, patients were systematically treated with anticoagulant <br>on the waiting list in order to achieve recanalization and/or prevent <br>extension. After LT, by contrast, none of the patients received specific <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. At time of surgical procedure, 54 of 91 patients still had <br>partial <span style="color: red">PVT</span> which was successfully treated by thrombectomy. In all these <br>patients, portal anastomosis was performed except in 2 who had <br>mesentericoportal anastomosis. Despite the absence of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, no <br>patients developed <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in the long term. Eight of 91 had no residual portal <br>vein nor mesenteric vein and only a cavernoma. In these patients, renoportal <br>anastomosis has been done in 5, and caval transposition in 3. Three-month <br>mortality rates were 94% in anatomic portal anastomoses and only 50% after <br>renoportal anastomosis or caval transposition. Our results show that postLT <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> should not be justified in recipients who had <span style="color: red">PVT</span> before LT <br>and in whom anatomic portal anastomosis can be perform. These data enhance <br>the hypothesis suggesting that the decrease in portal flow plays a major <br>role in the physiopathology of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in cirrhosis and that provided adequate <br>portal flow is restored to the graft, the risk of rethrombosis is low even <br>in the absence of specific <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>.<br><br>RECORD 490<br>Major digestive bleeding secondary to chronic portal venous thrombosis as <br>clinical onset of previously unknown hepatic cirrhosis complicated by <br>hepatic carcinoma<br>Arioli D.

Date of Publication: <br>May 2012<br><br>Introduction Hepatocarcinoma (HCC) is a complication of hepatic cirrhosis <br>(HC) generally detected in early stage due to Ultrasonographic (US) <br>surveillance in hepatopathic patients. It can be treated effectively with <br>well tolerated loco-regional treatment. In advanced stages of the disease, <br>HCC may be complicated by <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) that represents the <br>limiting element of the treatment and, therefore, the more devastating <br>prognostic element. Case reports We present two cases of major digestive <br>bleeding that led us to diagnose chronic <span style="color: red">PVT</span> due to silent HC complicated by <br>multifocal HCC. In both cases the diagnostic role of Doppler US study is <br>emphasized such as the importance of alpha fetoprotein requested in the <br>correct scenario. In both cases patients underwent endoscopic variceal <br>ligation (VL) regardless to the chance of etiologic treatment of HCC and <br>anticoagulant therapy was attempted. Just in the first case it was possible <br>to begin Sorafenib due to the better Child Class present at the diagnosis <br>(A5 versus B8). Conclusion Nowadays despite US surveillance in hepathopathic <br>patients lets generally the early diagnosis of HCC in pre-clinical phase, it <br>is still possible that digestive bleeding secondary to chronic <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>represents the clinical onset of previously unknown HC complicated by HCC. <br>In this scenario anticoagulant therapy can be considered just in case of <br>preserved liver function and should be individualized. Unlike the <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, VL is codified therapy and shouldn't be denied to patients <br>since it appears to significatively prolong surveillance.<br><br>RECORD 491<br>Spleno<span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in sepsis by severe diverticulitis<br>Gnocchi M.

Clinical case A 32 year old male came to our ED for <br>fever, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain. He was hospitalized with the <br>suspicious of acute gastroenteritis. Empirical antibiotic therapy <br>(ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin/clavulanate) was started and then improved <br>with metronidazole after blood culture results, positive for anaerobic <br>bacteria. Laboratory findings showed high activated Protein C, moderate <br>leukocytosis, mild hepatic function impairment. Abdominal ultrasonography <br>showed unattended probable spleno<span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>, initial <br>hepatosplenomegaly, colic inflammation signs, with oedema at the sigma <br>tract.

Case report We report the case of an 85 years <br>old man admitted to the Emergency Unit for hyperpirexia associated with <br>right upper quadrant and epigastric pain. He had a clinical history of COPD <br>(GOLD III) and hypertension; past gastric resection for early gastric cancer <br>and right emycolectomy for cancer, pT2 N0. On physical examination the <br>abdomen was tender in the upper quadrant and hepigastric regions. Clinical <br>signs (polypnea, increased heart rate, temperature >38°C) of SIRS were <br>present as well as laboratory findings (CRP 19 mg/dl, procalcytonin 27 <br>ng/ml) of sepsis. US examination showed partial <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, the pathogenesis of <br>which had to be defined. There were no laboratory nor instrumental (CT scan, <br>gastric and colonscopy) signs of an underlying hepatic chyrrosis nor of a <br>neoplastic disease relapse.

Martin P. Block M. McAlister V. Luke P. Sener A.<br>American Journal of Transplantation (2012) 12 SUPPL. 3 (265). Date of <br>Publication: May 2012<br><br>Introduction: Graft thrombosis is the most common cause of technical failure <br>in pancreas transplantation. It occur in up to 20% of patients and may be <br>due to both donor and recipient factors. There is no current evidence to <br>suggest that the use of anti-coagulation in the peri operative period has <br>any potential benefit of reducing the rates of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in <br>pancreas transplants. Objective: Retrospectively compare short and long term <br>clinical outcomes and complication rates in patients underwent simultaneous <br>kidney-pancreas transplants at our institution to determine if the use of <br>post operative heparin played any effect. Methods: 47 SPK transplants were <br>performed at our institution between 2004 and 2011. All patients since July <br>2009 (n=16) received a regimen of heparin (Group 1) at 300U/h for 24h, <br>followed by 400U/h until day 5, whereas patients transplanted prior to that <br>date (n=31) did not (Group 2). No bolus given and heparin was started in the <br>recovery unit. All patients were then placed on ASA on day 6 which they <br>continued indefinitely. We assessed Donor: age, BMI, DCD/NDD, ischemic time; <br>Recipient: age, previous transplant, previous thromboembolic events, <br>immunosuppression, serum biochemistry (creatinine, glucose, hemoglobin, <br>C-peptide, amylase, lipase, INR/PTT), complications (pancreatitis, DVT, PE, <br>graft thrombosis, hemorrhage, transfusions, re-operation, graft function and <br>loss). Serum parameters were measured pre-transplant and on days1, 3, 7, 14, <br>30, 180 and 360. Statistical analyses were carried out using a Fisher Exact <br>test and MANOVA. Results: 18% of Group 2 recipients lost their grafts to <br>portal vein thromboses versus 0% in Group 1 with an overall graft function <br>of 100% in Group 1 and 82% in Group 2 (p=0.11). One patient in Group 2 died <br>from a fatal pulmonary embolus whereas no fatalities were observed in the <br>heparinized group. Both groups had equal rates of transfusion and <br>re-exploration/drain insertion for peri pancreatic fluid collections. Serum <br>biochemical parameters for renal and pancreatic function were comparable <br>between the groups at the time of last follow-up. Conclusion: This study <br>provides novel information on the use of peri-operative intravenous <br>anti-coagulative therapy in SPK transplantation. Although not statistically <br>significant, there appears to be a clinically significant trend towards a <br>beneficial effect of the use of post-operative intravenous heparin in this <br>population. A larger cohort will be necessary to confirm these findings.<br><br>RECORD 494<br>Imaging and interventional radiology in congenital porto-systemic shunts<br>Kanavaki A. Anooshiravani M. Wildhaber B.

To review clinical and radiological manifestations of <br>five children with congenital portosystemic shunts (CPSS), as well as <br>treatment and outcome. Material and methods. Between 2008 and 2011, five <br>patients (age range, 12 days to 25 months) were admitted in our institution <br>with a diagnosis of CPSS, established by US (5), CT (5) and MRI (4). <br>Clinical presentation was hepatopulmonary syndrome (2), hepatoblastoma (1) <br>and liver failure (4). Three patients underwent angiography for further <br>evaluation. Results. In our series, three CPSS were extrahepatic, whereas <br>two were intrahepatic. Three CPSS were closed by endovascular procedures, <br>with a technical success of 100 %. One patient died 1 week after the <br>procedure from brain haemorrhage. In one patient, a new small (<2 mm) <br>intrahepatic shunt was detected on 24-hours US follow-up; the third patient <br>developed partial <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>, treated by <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. Two <br>patients were respectively transplanted 2 months and 1 year after diagnosis <br>of CPSS with a very good outcome. One asymptomatic patient has so far been <br>managed conservatively. Discussion and conclusions. CPSS is a rare condition <br>and may be related to intrauterine growth retardation, galactosemia, <br>cholestasis and hepatic encephalopathy. It may lead to hepatic tumours, <br>hepatopulmonary syndrome and pulmonary hypertension. Ultrasonography is the <br>first modality for diagnosis, with further work-up by contrast-enhanced <br>CT/MRI, and angiography if necessary.

Date of Publication: April <br>2012<br><br>Introduction and Aim: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is a frequent event in <br>patients with cirrhosis that could worsen outcome and even prevent liver <br>transplant (LT). <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> has been suggested as an alternative <br>therapy but there is limited data regarding safety and efficacy of this <br>treatment in these patients. This study evaluates these issues in a large <br>series of patients with cirrhosis and non-neoplastic <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Methods: <br>Fifty-five patients with cirrhosis diagnosed of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, from June 2003 to <br>September 2010, receiving <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> were included. Patients with <br>cavernomatous transformation were excluded. Diagnosis of thrombosis and the <br>evaluation of recanalization were performed with Doppler ultrasound, <br>angio-CT and/or angio-MRI. Results: The indication of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was <br>acute/subacute <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in 31 patients and progression of previously known <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in <br>24. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was based on low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) in 26 <br>patients; LMWH followed by vitamin K antagonists (VKA) in 21 and VKA alone <br>in the remaining 8. Partial or complete recanalization was obtained in 33 <br>patients (60%) complete in 25 (45%). Precocity in starting <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>was the only factor significantly associated with recanalization. Five of <br>the 13 patients that stopped <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> after achieve complete <br>recanalization developed rethrombosis (38.5%) after a median follow-up of <br>1.3 months. Despite similar baseline characteristics, patients achieving <br>recanalization develop during follow-up less frequent portal hypertension <br>related complications (portal hypertension related bleeding, ascites, <br>hepatic encephalopathy), but without achieving statistical significance (p = <br>0.1). Five patients developed bleeding complications probably related to <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. A platelet count <50×109/L was the only factor <br>significantly associated with a higher risk of experiencing a bleeding <br>complication. Six patients died due to liver disease but no deaths related <br>to <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> were observed. Conclusions: <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> achieves <br>complete recanalization of the portal venous axis in 45% of patients with <br>cirrhosis and <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, and this seems to be associated with a better outcome. <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> should be maintained indefinitely to prevent rethrombosis.<br><br>RECORD 498<br>Bleeding risk of Endoscopic Variceal Ligation (EVL) in patients with Portal <br>Vein Thrombosis (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) and <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>: An analysis of 1235 procedures<br>Christol C.

Date of Publication: April <br>2012<br><br>Introduction: The risk of variceal bleeding in patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is <br>approximately 12% per year. As in cirrhosis, EVL is an approved procedure <br>for the prevention of variceal bleeding regardless of the <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>regimen. The risk of bleeding during EVL procedure but also due to post <br>banding ulcers in these anticoagulated patients remains unknown. Our main <br>objective was to assess the risk and the severity of upper gastrointestinal <br>bleeding in patients treated by EVL while patients are on oral <br>anticoagulants. Patients and Methods: All consecutive patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, who <br>had at least one session of EVL between 2001 and 2010, were included. <br>Patients were 1:1 matched with cirrhotic patients according to sex and <br>severity of the disease. We collected all bleeding episodes during the EVL <br>program and for each, the following data: duration of hospitalization, days <br>in intensive care unit (ICU), presence of hemorrhagic shock and number of <br>red blood cell transfusion. Results: There were 30 anticoagulated patients <br>and 13 non anticoagulated patients in the “<span style="color: red">PVT</span> group” (total = 43) and 43 <br>non anticoagulated patients in “cirrhosis group”. Bleeding occured in 9/121 <br>(7.4%) EVL performed in the anticoagulated <span style="color: red">PVT</span> group, vs 6/130 (4.6%) EVL in <br>the non-anticoagulated <span style="color: red">PVT</span> group (NS). There was no difference between the 3 <br>groups in terms of number of hospitalizations, number of days in ICU, <br>prevalence of hemorrhagic shock and number of red blood cell transfusion. <br>Eradication was achieved an average 5.6 sessions in the “<span style="color: red">PVT</span> with <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>” group, 5.8 sessions in the “<span style="color: red">PVT</span> without <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>group” and 4.6 sessions in the “cirrhosis group” (NS). The eradication rates <br>were similar between the 3 groups (83% vs 84% vs 84%) (NS). The mean time of <br>eradication was also similar between the 3 groups. Conclusion: This study <br>shows for the first time that oral <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> - does not increase the <br>risk of UGB in patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> treated with EVL, nor the severity of <br>bleeding. - does not affect the rate nor the delay of oesophagal varices <br>eradication.<br><br>RECORD 499<br>Huge inflammatory pseudotumor of the spleen with postoperative portal vein <br>thrombosis: Report of a case<br>Tsutsumi N.

Malhotra K. Rijal J.<br>Journal of Hospital Medicine (2012) 7 SUPPL. 2 (S315). Date of Publication: <br>March 2012<br><br>Case Presentation: A 63-year-old man developed sudden onset of diffuse <br>abdominal pain associated with nausea and non-bilious vomiting 12 hours <br>after elective percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) with <br>drug eluting stent placement in the mid left anterior descending coronary <br>artery. There were no immediate post-procedure complications. Past medical <br>history was significant for hypertension, angina pectoris and dyslipidemia. <br>His daily medications were aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, metoprolol, <br>and sublingual nitroglycerine as needed for chest pain. Physical examination <br>was remarkable for tenderness in the epigastric region without rebound. Lab <br>tests revealed amylase of 400 U/L, lipase of 840 U/L, and WBC of 14000 (85 % <br>polymorphs). CT abdomen with contrast showed significant peripancreatic <br>stranding and filling defect in the portal vein, consistent with acute <br>pancreatitis and <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. Patient was kept NPO, given IV <br>fluids and was started on enoxaparin and coumadin. His symptoms improved and <br>he was discharged home on the third day. After 3 months, follow up CT <br>abdomen revealed complete resolution of pancreatitis and portal vein <br>thrombosis and hence his coumadin treatment was discontinued. Discussion: <br>Acute Pancreatitis is an extremely rare complication of PTCA procedure <br>resulting from atheromatous embolization of the pancreatic vessels. Ischemia <br>resulting from occlusion of vessels can lead to varying degrees of <br>pancreatic necrosis ranging from subtle changes to necrotizing pancreatitis. <br>Orvar and Johlin reported the largest series of acute pancreatitis after <br>cardiac catheterization or abdominal angiographic procedures. They studied <br>21,000 patients undergoing angiographic procedures and pancreatitis was <br>reported in only 0.4% of the cases. Our patient had no other risk factor for <br>pancreatitis such as alcoholism or cholelithiasis. Pancreatitis accounts for <br>only 3-5% of cases of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> via either a contiguous <br>inflammatory process, direct compression of the portal vein by a pseudocyst, <br>or a combination of both. In our case, the acute pancreatitis served as a <br>nidus for the development of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. Management of <br>pancreatis is largely supportive and <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> is considered for acute <br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. Conclusions: The triad of PTCA, acute pancreatitis <br>and <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> is extremely rare and to our knowledge this is <br>the first case ever reported in the literature. Although very rare, <br>atheromatous embolization and acute pancreatitis should be considered as one <br>of the possible causes of acute abdomen in patients who have undergone <br>angiographic procedures.

Kano N.<br>Surgical Endoscopy and Other Interventional Techniques (2012) 26 SUPPL. 1 <br>(S251). Date of Publication: March 2012<br><br>Introduction: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) after laparoscopic surgery is a <br>relatively uncommon but potentially lethal complication. There are several <br>reports of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> after laparoscopic surgery such as laparoscopic splenectomy. <br>There are only a few reports of cases with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> after laparoscopic colectomy <br>for malignant tumors. However, its true incidence may have been <br>underestimated due to difficulty in making the diagnosis. We report a case <br>of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in a patient with no hypercoagulable states and risk factors for <br>thrombosis, who underwent laparoscopy assisted low anterior resection of the <br>rectum. Case: The patient is a 55 year old male with no past medical <br>history. He noticed hematochezia and came to see his family physician. <br>Colonoscopy revealed an early stage rectal cancer. He underwent endoscopic <br>mucosal resection (EMR) for the lesion. The pathological examination showed <br>the mucosal lesion with no positive margin and no vessel invasion. A <br>follow-up colonoscopy showed a recurrent lesion. He undertook laparoscopy <br>assisted low anterior resection for the recurrent rectal cancer. On eleventh <br>day after operation, he noticed abdominal distention. Abdominal CT revealed <br>thrombi in the umbilical portion of the portal vein. His general condition <br>was stable and his symptom disappeared on the next day. We started systemic <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy with Warfarin. The thrombi were not detected on the <br>followup CT four months after the onset. We continued <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>therapy for six months after the follow-up CT. The patient is followed as an <br>outpatient with no signs of recurrence. Result: <span style="color: red">PVT</span> after laparoscopic <br>surgery is uncommon and difficult to diagnose because of nonspecific signs <br>and symptoms. Its presentation, treatment, and outcomes are poorly <br>understood. Possible etiologic factors are malignant tumors, abdominal <br>inflammatory diseases, alteration in coagulation during pneumoperitoneum, <br>intraoperative damage to the splanchnic endothelium and systemic <br>thrombophilic states. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> should be diagnosed and treated precisely and <br>promptly, because it can be lethal.<br><br>RECORD 504<br>Management of hepatic vascular diseases<br>Plessier A.

(i) Hepatic arterial disorders, <br>related mostly to iatrogenic injury and occasionally to systemic diseases, <br>lead to ischemic cholangiopathy. (ii) Hepatic vein or inferior vena cava <br>thrombosis, causing primary Budd-Chiari syndrome, is related typically to a <br>combination of underlying prothrombotic conditions, particularly <br>myeloproliferative neoplasms, factor V Leiden, and oral contraceptive use. <br>The outcome of Budd-Chiari syndrome has markedly improved with <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy and, when needed, angioplasty, stenting, TIPS, or <br>liver transplantation. (iii) Extrahepatic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> is related <br>to local causes (advanced cirrhosis, surgery, malignant or inflammatory <br>conditions), or general prothrombotic conditions (mostly myeloproliferative <br>neoplasms or factor II gene mutation), often in combination. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>at the early stage prevents thrombus extension and, in 40 of the cases, <br>allows for recanalization.

(iv) Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (or venoocclusive disease), <br>caused by agents toxic to bone marrow progenitors and to sinusoidal <br>endothelial cells, induces portal hypertension and liver dysfunction. <br>Decreasing the intensity of myeloablative regimens reduces the incidence of <br>sinusoidal toxicity.

Amitai M. Lubetsky A. Eliakim R. Chowers Y. Ben-Horin S.<br>Journal of Crohn's and Colitis (2012) 6 SUPPL. 1 (S107). Date of <br>Publication: February 2012<br><br>Background: Mesenteric and <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> are rare and frequently <br>underdiagnosed complications of Crohn's disease (CD). The data pertaining to <br>the prevalence, clinicoradiologic features of these patients and the <br>management approach is sparse. This study describes the clinical and <br>radiological characteristics of CD patients with superior mesenteric vein <br>thrombosis (MVT) diagnosed by CT or MRI. Methods: The database of Crohn's <br>disease patients treated in Sheba Medical Center between 2005 2010 was <br>searched for MVT diagnosis. Imaging studies of identified patients were <br>retrieved and reviewed by an experienced abdominal radiologist. MVT was <br>defined by superior mesenteric vein obliteration and/or thrombus in the <br>vessel lumen on abdominal imaging. The clinical and radiologic data of these <br>patients were collected from the medical records. Results: MVT was <br>demonstrated in 6/460 CD patients in our center's database. The mean disease <br>duration was 15 years. Five patients had stricturing disease, and one <br>patient had a combined fistulizing and stricturing disease phenotype. All 6 <br>patients had small bowel disease, but 3/6 also had colonic involvement. No <br>patient had a prior thromboembolic history or demonstrable <br>hypercoagulability. One patient had an acute SMV thrombus demonstrable on CT <br>scanning, the remaining patients showed an obliteration of superior <br>mesenteric vein. Two out of six patients received <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> upon <br>diagnosis of thrombosis, and four patients who were diagnosed <br>retrospectively did not. None of the patients developed subsequent <br>thromboembolic events (mean follow-up 2.25±1.5 years). Conclusions: The <br>incidence of mesenteric vein thrombosis is likely to be underestimated in <br>patients with Crohn's disease. Both CT and MRI imaging demonstrate the <br>extent of enteric disease and coincident SMV thrombosis. In our cohort, <br>thrombosis was associated with stricturing disease of the small bowel. The <br>clinical impact of SMV thrombosis and whether <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> is mandatory <br>for all of these patients remains to be determined.<br><br>RECORD 506<br>Japanese case of Budd-Chiari syndrome due to hepatic vein thrombosis <br>successfully treated with liver transplantation<br>Iwasaki T.

Date of Publication: February <br>2012<br><br>A 22-year-old Japanese woman was found to have severe esophageal varices and <br>then suffered from hepatic encephalopathy. She was diagnosed with <br>Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) due to hepatic vein (HV) thrombosis accompanied <br>by <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> without inferior vena cava (IVC) obstruction. <br>Latent myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) lacking the JAK2-V617F mutation was <br>considered to be the underlying disease. Liver transplantation was <br>strikingly effective for treating the clinical symptoms attributable to <br>portal hypertension. Although thrombosis of the internal jugular vein <br>occurred due to thrombocythemia, which manifested after transplantation <br>despite <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy with warfarin, the thrombus immediately <br>disappeared with the addition of aspirin. Neither thrombosis nor BCS has <br>recurred in more than 4years since the amelioration of the last thrombotic <br>event, and post-transplant immunosuppression with tacrolimus has not <br>accelerated the progression of MPN. In Japan, IVC obstruction, which was a <br>predominant type of BCS, is suggested to have decreased in incidence with <br>recent improvements in hygiene. The precise diagnosis of BCS and causative <br>underlying diseases should be made with attention to the current trend of <br>the disease spectrum, which fluctuates with environmental sanitation levels. <br>Because the stepwise strategy, including liver transplantation, has been <br>proven effective for patients with pure HV obstruction in Western countries, <br>this strategy should also be validated for utilization in Japan and in <br>developing countries where HV obstruction potentially predominates. © 2011 <br>The Japan Society of Hepatology.<br><br>RECORD 507<br>Right heart and pulmonary thromboembolism from extensive splanchnic vein <br>thrombosis after splenectomy for myeloproliferative disease<br>Stanziola A.A.

Streiff M.B.<br>Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2012) 18:1 (161-171). Date of Publication: <br>January 2012<br><br>Background: Thromboembolism (TE) is a common extraintestinal complication of <br>inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) is <br>being increasingly used to treat TE but often evokes fears of hemorrhagic <br>complications (HCs) in patients with IBD. We reviewed clinical outcomes with <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> (AC) and CDT in IBD patients with TE. Methods: Published <br>cases of IBD patients with TE were identified by a PubMed search. Cases were <br>divided into two groups based on treatment modality: AC alone or CDT. <br>Pretreatment variables and treatment-related outcomes were compared between <br>treatment groups. Results: Fifty-two cases of IBD-associated TE were <br>identified. Thirty-five cases were treated with AC alone and 17 with CDT. <br>There were no significant differences in pretreatment variables. Patients <br>treated with CDT tended to be more likely to achieve complete or partial <br>symptomatic (P = 0.02) and radiologic resolution (P = 0.06). <br>Gastrointestinal (GI) and non-GI HCs tended to occur more frequently with <br>CDT, although these differences were not statistically significant (P = 0.44 <br>and 0.15, respectively). Conclusions: CDT and AC both appear to be well <br>tolerated by IBD patients with TE. CDT may be used preferentially in <br>patients with life-threatening TE, while AC may be preferable in patients <br>with less clinically significant TE or patients at higher risk for bleeding. <br>Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these results and more <br>definitively identify the best therapeutic approach for patients with <br>IBD-associated TE.

Date of Publication: 18 Nov 2011<br><br>INTRODUCTION: Non-neoplastic chronic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is a <br>frecuent diagnosis in the course of <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span>, with reported <br>prevalences of 0.6% to 15,8%. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> can motivate life-threatening <br>complications due to worsening portal hypertension, so <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>therapy is challenging in these patients. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the response <br>to antithrombotic therapy and changes in liver function tests in 28 patients <br>with chronic <span style="color: red">PVT</span> associated with cirrhosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 28 <br>consecutive patients with <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> and chronic <span style="color: red">PVT</span> were treated with <br>antithrombotic therapy from 2004 to 2009. Hepatocellular carcinoma and known <br>thrombophilic risks were ruled out. Therapy consisted in 15 days of <br>therapeutic doses of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) (enoxaparin) <br>adjusted according to baseline coagulability (Table 1), followed by either <br>prophylactic doses (40mg/day) of LMWH or acenocoumarol (target INR 2-3), <br>during 6 months. Response was evaluated after 6 months. If recanalization <br>was complete, therapy was suspended. If recanalization was partial or no <br>recanalization was observed, therapy was continued until response. [Table <br>Presented] RESULTS: From the 28 patients studied, 19 (68%) were males with a <br>median age of 53 years (range 35-77). Cirrhosis was due to alcoholism (25%), <br>virus (54%), mixed in 1 patient and other causes in 3 patients. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> involved <br>the portal trunk and/or branches in 19/28 (68%) patients, mesenteric vein in <br>2 patients and portal trunk and/or branches, mesenteric and/or splenic vein <br>thrombosis coexisted in 7 patients. 19/28 (68%) of the patients had moderate <br>or moderate-severe hypocoagulability range. Complete and partial thrombosis <br>was seen in 18 and 10 patients at diagnosis, respectively. From the 28 <br>patients, 18 (64%) responded to antithrombotic therapy after 6 months, with <br>a complete recanalization in 13 patients 13/18 (72%) and partial in 5/18 <br>patients (28%). None of the 28 patients presented hemorrhagic complications <br>and none showed platelets counts below baseline values. 17 from the 18 <br>patients who responded, showed altered liver function tests before therapy. <br>After 6 months, 8/17 (47%) improved liver function (only one patient had <br>received antiviral therapy). After a median follow up of 42 months (range <br>7-67), 15/18 (83%) patients continued showing complete or partial response <br>while 3 patients progressed. Of note, 3 patients of this group could proceed <br>to further liver transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Antithrombotic therapy in <br>chronic <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in cirrhotic patients resulted in a high response rate (64%) in <br>our study, with a complete recanalization in 72% of the cases. Adjusted dose <br>scheme according to level of hypocoagulability seems to be effective and <br>safe, since 63% of the subgroups of moderate and moderate-severe <br>hypocoagulability responded with no haemorrhagic complications.<br><br>RECORD 515<br>Management of acute non-cirrhotic and non-malignant <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>: <br>a systematic review.<br>Hall T.C.

Date of Publication: Nov <br>2011<br><br>No definitive evidence exists regarding the treatment of acute portal vein <br>thrombosis (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>). Treatment modalities described include conservative <br>management, <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, thrombolysis, and thrombectomy. This review <br>examines the impact of such treatment, its outcomes, and the complications <br>resulting from the resultant portal hypertension. A Medline literature <br>search was undertaken using the keywords <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>, <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, thrombolysis, and thrombectomy. The primary end point was <br>portal vein recanalization. Secondary outcome measures were morbidity and <br>the development of portal hypertension and its sequelae, including variceal <br>bleeding. Data from articles relating to <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in the context of cirrhosis, <br>malignancy, or liver transplant were excluded. Early systemic <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> results in complete portal vein recanalization in 38.3% of <br>cases and partial recanalization in 14.0% of cases. Spontaneous <br>recanalization without treatment can only be expected in up to 16.7% of <br>patients. Frequently this is only when associated with self-limiting <br>underlying pathology and/or minimal thrombus extension. Thrombolysis can be <br>associated with major complications in up to 60% of patients. The natural <br>history of acute <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is poorly described.

Early <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> results in a <br>satisfactory rate of recanalization with minimal procedure-associated <br>morbidity.

In this case, complications must be anticipated, prevented or at <br>least controlled by the best available therapeutic modalities. There are <br>three main goals for the management of portal hypertension: (i) prevention <br>of the first episode of variceal bleeding largely by non-selective <br>β-adrenoceptor antagonists, which is not generally recommended in children; <br>(ii) control of bleeding by using a stepwise approach from the least to most <br>invasive strategies; (iii) and prevention of re-bleeding using bypass <br>operations, with particular enthusiasm for the use of meso-Rex bypass in the <br>pediatric population. Hepatic encephalopathy management also consists of <br>three main aspects: (i) ruling out other causes of encephalopathy; (ii) <br>identifying and treating precipitating factors; and (iii) starting empiric <br>treatment with drugs such as lactulose, rifaximin, sodium benzoate, and <br>flumazenil. Treatment of mild ascites and peripheral edema should begin with <br>the restriction of sodium and water, followed by careful diuresis, then <br>large-volume paracentesis associated with colloid volume expansion in severe <br>cases. Empiric broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy should be used for the <br>treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, bacterial and fungal sepsis, <br>and cholangitis, after taking appropriate cultures, with appropriate changes <br>in therapy after sensitivity testing. Empirical therapies continue to be the <br>standard practice for pruritus; these consist of bile acid binding agents, <br>phenobarbital (phenobarbitone), ursodeoxycholic acid, antihistamines, <br>rifampin (rifampicin), and carbamazepine. Partial external biliary diversion <br>can be used in refractory cases. Once hepatorenal syndrome is suspected, <br>treatment should be initiated early in order to prevent the progression of <br>renal failure; approaches consist of general supportive measures, management <br>of concomitant complications, screening for sepsis, treatment with <br>antibiotics, use of vasopressin analogs (terlipressin), and renal <br>replacement therapy if needed. Hepatopulmonary syndrome and portopulmonary <br>hypertension are best managed by liver transplantation. Provision of an <br>adequate caloric supply, nutrition, and vitaminmineral supplements for the <br>management of growth failure, required vaccinations, and special care for <br>ensuring psychologic well-being should be ensured. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> might be <br>attempted in acute <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>.Some CLDs, such as extrahepatic <br>biliary atresia (EHBA), Crigler-Najjar syndrome, and Indian childhood <br>cirrhosis, require special considerations. For EHBA, Kasai <br>hepatoportoenterostomy is the current standard surgical approach in <br>combination with nutritional therapy and supplemental fat and water soluble <br>vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. In type 1 Crigler-Najjar syndrome, <br>extensive phototherapy is the mainstay of treatment, in association with <br>adjuvant therapy to bind photobilirubin such as calcium phosphate, <br>cholestyramine, or agar, until liver transplantation can be carried out. <br>Treating Indian childhood cirrhosis with penicillamine early in the course <br>of the disease and at doses similar to those used to treat Wilson disease <br>decreases the mortality rate by half.New hopes for the future include <br>extracorporeal liver support devices (the molecular adsorbent recirculating <br>system MARS® and Prometheus®), hepatocyte transplantation, liver-directed <br>gene therapy, genetically engineered enzymes, and therapeutic modalities <br>targeting fibrogenesis.

Date of Publication: October 2011<br><br>Introduction: The prevalence of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> increases with the severity of liver <br>disease, being less than 1% in patients with well compensated Child's A <br>cirrhosis to as high as 10% in decompensated patients awaiting liver <br>transplant. In most patients with <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span>, development of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is <br>often accompanied by increased rate of morbidity and mortality and affect <br>patient candidacy for liver transplant. Furthermore, there is limited data <br>regarding the role of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy in patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and liver <br>cirrhosis. Objectives:1.Describe the prevalence of hypercoaguable disorders <br>in patients with <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> and <span style="color: red">PVT</span> 2. Describe outcome of <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in patients with <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> and mesenteric or <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. <br>Methods: Retrospective chart review of patients with end stage liver disease <br>(ESLD) awaiting liver transplant who were diagnosed with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> or superior <br>mesenteric vein thrombosis between January 2005 and April 2011. Data <br>recorded include etiology of liver disease, extent of thrombus, results of <br>hypercoagaulable work up, lenght of treatment, and response to treatment. <br>Results:Sixty-eight patients were diagnosed with mesenteric vein thrombosis <br>during the study period:48/68 had isolated <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, 15/68 patients had combined <br>mesenteric and <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, and 5/68 patients had isolated mesenteric vein <br>thrombosis. Chronic hepatitis C was the cause of liver disease in 23/68 <br>patients (34%), hepatocellular carcinoma was noted 25/68 (37%) of patients <br>(all HCC patients met the transplant criteria). Screening for hypercoaguable <br>disorder became a standard practice during the second half of the study <br>period: 20 patients were screened and hypercoaguable disorder was diagnosed <br>in 1/20 (5%). <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was initiated based on a strict protocol that <br>included variceal eradication prior to treatment. Patients were treated for <br>6-12 months . Seventeen (17/68) patients were treated during the study <br>period with coumadin. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> resolved in 6/17 (35%), showed partial resolution <br>in 7/17(41%), no change in 2/17, and 2/17 patients did not have adequate <br>follow up yet. One patient (5%) had significant vaginal bleeding on coumadin <br>and treatment stopped after 10 months. None of the treated patients had GI <br>bleeding. Conclusions: <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is frequently seen in patients with ESLD. <br>Hypercoaguable disorder was detected in 5% of the patients screened. Careful <br>use of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> is safe and associated with thrombus resolution or <br>partial resolution in 35% and 41% of patients respectively.

Date of Publication: October <br>2011<br><br>Background/aims: <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> is considered the therapy of choice in <br>patients with non-cirrhotic portal vein occlusion, while concerns regarding <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy are still present in patients with cirrhosis because <br>of the high risk of bleeding related to clotting impairment and portal <br>hypertension. Recently, safety and efficacy of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy (AT) <br>in cirrhotic patients have been shown, but little is known about long-term <br>outcome and resolution of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> with or without therapeutic intervention in <br>this setting of patients. The aim of this study was to compare two <br>well-matched cohorts of cirrhotic patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> undergoing either <br>therapy with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or only clinical <br>observation. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed data on cirrhotic patients <br>with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> followed in our Unit and selected two cohorts of patients well <br>matched for clinical and demographic characteristics: patients treated with <br>LMWH (group A) and patients who didn't receive AT (group B). Exclusion <br>criteria were advanced <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> (Child-Pugh C), liver transplantation <br>during follow-up, cavernomatous transformation of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>, <br>presence of neoplasms and active variceal bleeding or high-risk esophageal <br>varices. Imaging of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> with Doppler ultrasound or spiral CT/MRI was <br>evaluated at baseline and 6 months after inclusion. Thrombosis was <br>considered occludent when involving more than 75% of the vessel with minimal <br>or absent blood flow; complete response was defined as whole recanalization <br>or a reduction of more than 50% of the thrombus. Results: A total of 66 <br>cirrhotic patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> were evaluated in order to select 15 patients <br>with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> (33% with occludent thrombosis) receiving LMWH for 3-6 months and <br>15 patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> (20% with occludent thrombosis) who didn't receive AT. <br>LMWH therapy was administered for 3-6 months or until resolution of <br>thrombosis, with no major side effects such as uncontrolled bleeding <br>reported. Complete portal recanalization occurred in 7 out 15 patients in <br>group A and in 5 out of 15 patients in group B (46% vs 33% complete <br>resolution; p=0,45), suggesting no clear advantage for AT. Conclusions: As <br>cirrhosis is characterized by a complex haemostasis defect including primary <br>haemostasis, coagulation and fibrinolysis, clinical outcome of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> may not <br>always be easily predictable. Because evidence of a real clinical benefit <br>from AT in cirrhotic patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is still lacking, more interventional <br>studies evaluating the outcome predictors of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and benefit of AT in <br>selected patient population are warranted.<br><br>RECORD 522<br>An interesting case of chronic idiopathic non-cirrhotic portal vein <br>thrombosis<br>Shah N.

Date <br>of Publication: October 2011<br><br>Purpose: Introduction: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> was first reported in 1868 by <br>Balfour and Stewart. It is a rare condition that typically presents in <br>non-cirrhotic patients. Inherited (Factor V Leiden and Prothrombin gene <br>mutation G201210A, Protein C, S, Anti thrombin III deficiency) and acquired <br>thrombophilias (Lupus Anticoagulant, myeloproliferative diseases, <br>malignancy, surgery and trauma) account for majority of the cases of portal <br>vein thrombosis. Doppler ultrasound studies are usually the initial test of <br>choice. Case Report: 63 year old Hispanic Female with history of <br>hypertension, Diabetes Mellitus, coronary artery disease presented with <br>complaints of epigastric pain &bloody vomiting. She initially had epigastric <br>discomfort &2 episodes of hematemesis. She denied alcohol use. Abdominal <br>examination was unremarkable except for mild epigastric tenderness. <br>Laboratory analysis revealed hemoglobin of 10.5 mg/dl with normal liver <br>function tests and aminotransferases. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopic <br>examination was done which revealed grade 4 esophageal varices with fresh <br>blood in the distal esophagus which were subsequently ligated. She was <br>started on octreotide and propranolol. She had another episode of GI bleed <br>requiring emergent endoscopic intervention. She underwent a liver biopsy. <br>Pathology revealed focal mild portal fibrosis with mild micro &macro <br>vesicular steatosis but no cirrhosis. A Doppler Ultrasound revealed portal <br>vein thrombosis and concomitant portal hypertension. An extensive <br>hypercoaguable work up was done which included protein C &S levels, anti <br>thrombin III, Prothrombin gene mutation G20210A, Factor V Leiden, Lupus <br>anticoagulant, Anticardiolipin antibodies, Homocysteine level &they were all <br>negative. We also tested her blood for flow-cytometry for CD 55 and CD 59 <br>but the test was normal and in the process effectively ruled out paroxysmal <br>nocturnal hemoglobinuria. She also was also tested for the JAK 2 mutation. <br>It was negative. We gave her the clinical diagnosis of chronic idiopathic <br>non-cirrhotic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. She subsequently had a meso-caval <br>shunt done to relieve the portal hypertension. She was started on warfarin <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> 3 days later with close monitoring for bleeding. She <br>clinically got better and was then discharged home. Discussion: <br>Non-cirrhotic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> can be acute or chronic. Acute cases <br>need at least 3 months of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. Chronic cases needs <br>porto-systemic shunting. The use of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in chronic cases should <br>be decided upon on a case by case basis weighing the risk of bleeding versus <br>thrombosis. We opted to give long-term <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> to our patient to <br>prevent re-thrombosis of the meso-caval shunt/graft.<br><br>RECORD 523<br>Enoxaparin prevents <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) and decompensation in <br>advanced cirrhotic patients: Final report of a prospective randomized <br>controlled study<br>Villa E.

Date of Publication: October 2011<br><br><span style="color: red">PVT</span> is a frequent complication of advanced cirrhosis, occurring in about <br>8-25% of patients and leading to severe clinical deterioration, <br>decompensation and death. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> has never been prospectively <br>tested for its prevention. We therefore designed a prospective randomized <br>trial of anticoagulant therapy in advanced cirrhotic patients with following <br>endpoints: primary - evaluation of efficacy in preventing <span style="color: red">PVT</span>; secondary - <br>assessment of safety, prevention of decompensation and/or survival (Eudract <br>2007-007890-22). Cirrhotic patients, Child B7- C10, were randomized to <br>receive enoxaparin 4000 IU/die or placebo for 12 months followed by 12 <br>months observation. US was performed every 3 months and CT every 6 months to <br>check for portal vein axis. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was considered as relevant when it was <br>either complete or involved more than 50% of PV diameter and was <br>symptomatic. We report the events of the 70 enrolled patients (34 randomized <br>to treatment and 36 to placebo) at completion of the 24 months study. No <br>relevant side effects, in particular no hemorrhagic events, were <br>attributable to the active drug. Only one patient was withdrawn from active <br>arm because of thrombocytopenia. During the 1-year study period, <span style="color: red">PVT</span> (3 <br>complete, 3 partial) occurred in 6/36 (16.7%) patients on placebo and in <br>none on enoxaparin [p=0.023 chi sq test)]. One patient with complete <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>died of septic shock shortly after developing <span style="color: red">PVT</span> while the others recovered <br>after acute <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. During follow-up, 6 additional thrombotic <br>events occurred, 3 in the placebo group and 3 in the active arm, 2 to 6 <br>months after enoxaparin discontinuation (p=0.746). Decompensation occurred <br>during the study period significantly more in placebo than in <br>enoxaparin-treated patients [placebo 19/36 (52.7%) vs. 4/34 (11.7% ), <br>p=0.0007]; this advantage was greatly attenuated but not lost during <br>follow-up [placebo: 18/34 (52.9%) vs 7/29 (24.1%); p=0.02]. Survival was <br>significantly better in enoxparin-treated patients (log rank 0.019). At <br>logistic regression analysis, the only factor significantly associated with <br>risk of developing <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was degree of portal hypertension (OR 9.16; 95%CI <br>1.1592- 52.780; p=0.013). The independent factors associated with risk of <br>decompensation were bilirubin levels (OR 1.667; 95%CI 1.026-2.710, p=0.039) <br>and enoxaparin treatment (OR 0.106, 95%CI 0.024-0.469, p=0.003). In this <br>prospective randomized controlled study in advanced stage cirrhotics, <br>enoxaparin was shown to be safe and effective in preventing <span style="color: red">PVT</span> but, most <br>importantly, was associated with greatly reduced occurrence of <br>decompensation both during the active period of treatment and in the <br>follow-up period. (Table Presented).<br><br>RECORD 524<br>Spontaneous spleno-renal shunt in patients with <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> is a <br>predisposing factor for hepatic encephalopathy<br>John B.V. Konjeti V.R. Lopez R. Carey W.D.<br>Hepatology (2011) 54 SUPPL. 1 (1252A). Date of Publication: October 2011<br><br>Background: Spontaneous spleno-renal shunts (SRS) are often seen in <br>cirrhotics with portal hypertension. We have observed that SRS is seen more <br>often in cirrhotics with <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>). SRS may result in <br>shunting of blood away from the portal vein leading to sluggish flow and <br>predispose to <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. However, it's unclear if SRS is the cause or effect of <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Aims: The primary aim of this study is to assess if existence of SRS <br>predisposes to development of new <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in cirrhotics. Secondary aims include <br>role of SRS on onset of ascites, hepatic encephalopathy and death. Methods: <br>We included all cirrhotics evaluated for LT between 07/2004 and 06/2009 who <br>had a minimum follow up of six months and at least one follow up imaging. <br>Subjects with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> at baseline, HCC or on anti-coagulation were excluded. <br>Subjects were evaluated for SRS at baseline and prospectively followed with <br>Doppler and CT or MRI of the abdomen with contrast every 6 months till LT, <br>removal from transplant list, or death. Results: Of the 902 cirrhotics <br>evaluated for LT, 243 met the inclusion criteria. Forty nine had SRS (group <br>1) and 194 had no SRS on baseline imaging (group 2). Cirrhotics with NASH <br>were more likely to have SRS than those without (27% vs. 14%; p=0.035). <br>There was no difference in baseline MELD between the two groups (14.7 vs. <br>13.8, p=0.23). Over a median follow up of approximately 24 months, 14% with <br>SRS at baseline developed <span style="color: red">PVT</span> compared to 8% in cirrhotics without (p=0.2). <br>On multi-variate analysis, after adjusting for presence of ascites and <br>creatinine, subjects with SRS were not at increased risk of developing <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>(Relative risk 1.5, 95% CI 0.61-3.7, p=0.37). There was no difference in the <br>development of new onset ascites (32.7 vs. 36.8%, p=0.59) or encephalopathy <br>(20.4 vs. 19.1%, p=0.83) between subjects with and without SRS. However, <br>subjects with SRS and <span style="color: red">PVT</span> were more likely to develop hepatic encephalopathy <br>compared to those with SRS and no <span style="color: red">PVT</span> (50% vs. 7%; p=0.022). There was no <br>difference in pre or post-transplant mortality between subjects with and <br>without SRS. Conclusion: Spontaneous spleno-renal shunts are seen in <br>approximately 20% of cirrhotics evaluated for OLT and is more commonly seen <br>in NASH cirrhosis. Subjects with spleno-renal shunt do not have an increased <br>risk to develop <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and is not associated with worsening liver disease or <br>mortality. However, cirrhotics with SRS and <span style="color: red">PVT</span> have a higher incidence of <br>hepatic encephalopathy. We hypothesize that the development of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> results <br>in bypassing of blood from the portal vein to the spleno-renal shunt, <br>resulting in encephalopathy.<br><br>RECORD 525<br>Pylephlebitis: A classically ambiguous presentation, with a rarely reported <br>organism<br>Lee S. Go B. Stroger J.H.<br>American Journal of Gastroenterology (2011) 106 SUPPL. 2 (S281). Date of <br>Publication: October 2011<br><br>Purpose: A previously healthy 46-year-old-man presented to the emergency <br>department with melena. He also described fevers, chills, anorexia, and <br>post-prandial pain, treated with ibuprofen. Temperature was 102.3F, blood <br>pressure 80/35 mmHg, heart rate 104/min, respiratory rate 20/min. Abdomen <br>was mildly tender in the right upper quadrant. There was no stigmata of <br>chronic liver disease. Rectal exam showed brown stool. Nasogastric lavage <br>was clear. WBC count 12,600/uL (95% neutrophils); Hemoglobin 8.3 g/dL; <br>platelets 147,000/uL. Sodium 127 mEq/L; BUN/Creatinine normal. Total <br>bilirubin 1.8 mg/dL; direct bilirubin 1.1 mg/dL; remaining liver profile <br>normal. Albumin 2.0 g/dL; total protein 4.6 g/dL; cholesterol 90 mg/dL. INR <br>1.3. Abdominopelvic CT showed “dilated intrahepatic biliary ducts, mainly <br>right lobe...probably cholangitis.” EGD found erosive esophagitis and <br>gastritis. ERCP revealed a normal biliary system without defect or dilation. <br>Repeated review of the CT suggested thrombus in the right portal vein, <br>mimicking dilated biliary ducts, confirmed with abdominal ultrasound. Blood <br>cultures grew Streptococcus intermedius in 4/4 bottles. Given the <br>constellation of acute <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>), fever, abdominal <br>discomfort, bacteremia/sepsis, the diagnosis of pylephlebitis was made. <br>Pylephlebitis is septic thrombophlebitis of the portal vein and its <br>tributaries. Intra-abdominal infection predisposes microthrombi formation, <br>extension of which results in this rare cause of acute <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Diverticulitis <br>has replaced appendicitis as the most common underlying primary infection. <br>The hallmark of pylephlebitis is its remarkably vague presentation. In three <br>well referenced series, 100% had fever, 74-100% abdominal pain, and 23-79% <br>were bacteremic. Other features include leukocytosis and abnormal liver <br>function tests; jaundice is a late finding. Enteric organisms are most <br>frequently isolated, especially the uniquely thrombogenic Bacteroides <br>species. S. intermedius has been reported in 2 other cases. This is the <br>first English language case in which S. intermedius is the sole organism. <br>Antibiotics and eradication of the primary infection are mainstays of <br>therapy; the role of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> is still debated. Mortality remains <br>significant at 10-50%. In this case, the presenting issue was the result of <br>NSAID induced esophagitis/gastritis, itself resultant from the abdominal <br>symptoms associated with pylephlebitis. Anemia and hypotension were <br>initially attributed to GI bleeding, though in context of other findings, <br>are entirely consistent with sepsis.

Kimura K. Saeki S. Hayashi S.<br>Hepatology (2011) 54 SUPPL. 1 (1263A). Date of Publication: October 2011<br><br>Background: Antithrombin III (AT-III) has been reported to be an effective <br>anticoagulant agent for <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>). However AT-III is very <br>expensive and it costs 1049 dollars per day. On the other hand danaparoid <br>sodium is inexpensive and it costs 36 dollars per day. The function of <br>danaparoid sodium is dependent on AT-III. Consequently it is assumed that <br>danaparoid sodium could not have sufficient anticoagulant activity under low <br>plasma AT-III level such as <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span>. In this study, we assessed the <br>effectiveness of danaparoid sodium for <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Methods: The subjects were 17 <br>patients (M/F=10/7, mean age 64.2 years) who were diagnosed <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and were <br>treated with danaparoid sodium at our institute from April 2006 to March <br>2011. 1250 U/body of danaparoid sodium was administered twice a day <br>intravenously for 14 days. Enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) was taken to <br>evaluate <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. We assessed if plasma AT-III level or the time from diagnosis <br>to treatment had correlation with treatment effect by statistical analysis. <br>Results: Of 17 patients, 12 patients (71%) had neoplasm and 9 patients (53%) <br>had <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> or portal hypertension. 3 patients (18%) were affected <br>with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> after laparotomy, and one patient (6%) was affected with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> after <br>transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). In 16 patients, treatment <br>effect was evaluated by CT images after treatment. In 14 of 16 patients <br>(88%), <span style="color: red">PVT</span> disappeared or was markedly reduced in size. In 2 patients (12%), <br>the treatment was ineffective. There was no significant correlation between <br>treatment effect and the time from diagnosis to treatment. Plasma AT-III <br>level was measured in 8 of 17 patients before treatment. Mean activity of <br>plasma AT-III was 68.2 %. In 5 patients, plasma AT-III level was lower than <br>the standard value (80 -120 %). However, in all of 8 patients, most of the <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span> disappeared.

Date of Publication: 2 September 2011<br><br>Idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension (INCPH) is characterized by an <br>increased portal venous pressure gradient in the absence of a known cause of <br>liver disease and <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. In contrast to the high prevalence <br>of this disorder in India, INCPH is a rare disease in the Western world. The <br>etiology of INCPH can be divided in five categories: chronic infections, <br>exposure to medication or toxins, thrombophilia, immunological disorders, <br>and genetic disorders. Multifactorial etiology can also be encountered. <br>Chronic abdominal infection is incriminated as the most important <br>etiological factor in Eastern patients and thrombophilia in Western <br>patients. The majority of patients with INCPH initially present with signs <br>or complications of portal hypertension (mainly variceal bleeding and <br>splenomegaly). These patients usually have preserved liver function. Liver <br>function impairment occurs mainly in the context of intercurrent conditions. <br>Patients with INCPH are often clinically and radiologically misdiagnosed as <br><span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span>, so that a liver biopsy is indispensable to discriminate <br>cirrhosis from INCPH. Histopathological characteristics of INCPH are <br>heterogeneous, demonstrating overlap between several pathological entities <br>(e.g., hepatoportal sclerosis, nodular regenerative hyperplasia, and <br>incomplete septal cirrhosis). Even though hemodynamical changes in INCPH <br>patients are not comparable to those in cirrhotics, prophylaxis and <br>treatment of variceal bleeding are recommended to be similar. <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy must be considered only in patients who develop <br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>.

Anstee Q.M. Sogaard K.K. Primignani M. Valla D.C.<br>Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2011) 9:9 (1713-1723). Date of <br>Publication: September 2011<br><br>Decreased levels of most coagulation factors and thrombocytopenia are the <br>main haemostatic abnormalities of cirrhosis. As a consequence, this <br>condition was, until recently, considered as the prototype acquired <br>coagulopathy responsible for bleeding. However, recent evidence suggests <br>that it should, rather, be regarded as a condition associated with normal or <br>even increased thrombin generation. The bleeding events that occur in these <br>patients should, therefore, be explained by the superimposed conditions that <br>frequently occur in this setting. Due to elevated levels of factor VIII <br>(procoagulant driver) in combination with decreased protein C (anticoagulant <br>driver), which are typically found in patients with cirrhosis, a <br>procoagulant imbalance, defined as a partial resistance to the in vitro <br>anticoagulant action of thrombomodulin, can be demonstrated. Whether this in <br>vitro hypercoagulability is truly representative of what occurs in vivo <br>remains to be established. However, the hypothesis that it may have clinical <br>consequences is attractive and deserves attention. The possible consequences <br>that we discuss herein include whether (i) cirrhosis is a condition <br>associated with increased risk of venous thromboembolism or portal vein <br>thrombosis; (ii) the hypercoagulability associated with cirrhosis has any <br>other role outside coagulation (i.e. progression of liver fibrosis); and <br>(iii) <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> should be used in cirrhosis. Although apparently <br>provocative, considering <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> as a therapeutic option in patients <br>with cirrhosis is now supported by a rationale of increasing strength. There <br>may be subgroups of patients who benefit from <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> to treat or <br>prevent thrombosis and to slow hepatic fibrosis. Clinical studies are <br>warranted to explore these therapeutic options. © 2011 International Society <br>on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.<br><br>RECORD 532<br>TIPS in children<br>Goffette P.P.<br>CardioVascular and Interventional Radiology (2011) 34 SUPPL. 3 (451-453). <br>Date of Publication: September 2011<br><br>Learning Objectives: 1. To review the indications for TIPS in children 2. To <br>describe the special technical considerations 3. To present the results and <br>complications Pediatric experience with transjugular intrahepatic <br>portosystemic stent-shunt (TIPSS), first described in 1992 by Kerns, is <br>limited to case reports and small series and long-term results are lacking. <br>Limiting factors to the wide-spread use of TIPSS in children include the <br>lack of adequate pediatric device, technical difficulty because of the small <br>size of the portal and hepatic veins and the presence of anatomical <br>variants. Although the complications of portal hypertension in children are <br>similar to those in adults, the underlying disease processes differ <br>substantially. The main causes of portal hypertension in children are <br>biliary atresia (40-45%), congenital hepatic fibrosis, a1-antitrypsin <br>deficiency, mucovisidosis, Budd-Chiari syndrome, veno-occlusive disease and <br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. Current indications for TIPSS placement in children <br>include control of acute and recurrent variceal bleeding (gastroesophageal, <br>intestine, jejuno-jejunostomy or stoma) due to sinusoidal or post-sinusoidal <br>portal hypertension, medically refractory ascites and hepatic hydrothorax. <br>Although children requiring long-term treatment of complicated portal <br>hypertension are more commonly considered for surgical portosystemic shunts <br>because of an improved patency, possible long-term indications for TIPSS <br>include congenital hepatic fibrosis due to polycystic kidney disease, cystic <br>fibrosis and other conditions in which liver function may stabilize or <br>improve with treatment, such as infectious or autoimmune hepatitis or <br>cholangitis. TIPSS after liver transplantation is feasible but could be very <br>challenging especially after split liver transplantation because of the risk <br>of extrahepatic portal vein puncture. In this clinical setting, patency of <br>the hepatic artery should be verified before TIPSS to avoid major ischemic <br>complications. Special technical considerations: 1. Technical differences <br>between pediatric patients and adults to perform TIPSS include, for the <br>pediatric group the need for general anesthesia and for shorter size of <br>metallic stent and technical modifications to access the portal vein. For <br>the choice of the type of stent, anticipation of future liver growth and <br>interference with liver transplantation should be kept in mind. 2. Smaller <br>sheaths (<9 fr) and puncture systems (>16G) than those used for adults <br>paradoxically increase the difficulty of the procedure in children because <br>cirrhotic livers in children are rock-hard, especially in case of biliary <br>atresia due to extensive fibrosis at the portal triad and the small size of <br>the portal vein. Therefore, despite very small portal and hepatic veins in <br>children, adults standard needles (Colapinto or Roesch-Uchida) are commonly <br>used for TIPSS creation. Often a mismatch between needle size and vessel <br>diameter necessitates ultrasound monitoring and subtle guidewire maneuvers <br>to enter the portal vein. Another condition impending sometimes the portal <br>vein puncture is the peripheral course of the major hepatic veins displaced <br>by hyperplastic parenchymal nodules. 3. Various manoeuvers for visualizing <br>the portal system could be useful in case of failed blind punctures of small <br>or tortuous intrahepatic portal branches: - Transhepatic placement of a <br>0.018-in wire into the portal vein under sonographic guidance. - <br>Transabdominal ultrasound guidance of transjugular portal vein puncture. - <br>Indirect portal venography by wedged hepatic vein injection using CO2, with <br>combination of road-mapping or overlay function. - Transfemoral placement of <br>a guidewire into the hepatic artery. - Transplenic portal vein targeting. 4. <br>Alternative approaches in case of failed conventional jugular approach have <br>been reported and include a. direct percutaneous transhepatic porto-hepatic <br>connection under sonographic and/or fluoroscopic guidance, the so-called <br>“Gun-sight technique” using two loop snares placed within an hepatic vein <br>and a portal vein, b. direct connection between the suprahepatic IVC and the <br>portal vein in BCS patient with hepatic vein and inferior vena cava <br>thrombosis, c. combined direct percutaneous transhepatic and trans-femoral <br>approaches. 5. Unlike adults for whom covered Viatorr stents (WL Gore) are <br>usually and widely preferable, the strategy for stent selection in children <br>depends on a variety of anatomic and clinical factors including the measured <br>size of the main portal vein and hepatic vein on US, age less than 3 years <br>and weight less than 30 kg. Because they are available in a wide range of <br>size and length and could be initially under dilated and later completely <br>dilate or even over dilated according to the liver growth, bare stents has <br>been more commonly placed in children rather than covered stents. Both <br>self-expanding (Wallstent, Boston Scientific) and balloon-expandable stents <br>(Palmaz, Cordis, Johnson&Johnson) have been used, alone or in combination in <br>order to combine flexibility and conformability of the first and the radial <br>force of the second, especially in case of extensive portal fibrosis <br>associated with biliary atresia. The combination of a covered stent placed <br>within the parenchymal tract to avoid acute thrombosis and delayed stenosis <br>with bare stents extending proximally and distally has been applied <br>successfully in children. Appropriate stent positioning in relation to the <br>portal and hepatic veins is important in potential liver transplant <br>candidate. A malpositioned stent could increase the difficulty of <br>transplantation by hampering vascular control or completion of the <br>anastomosis to the hepatic or portal vein. There are few data on the <br>clinical use of e-PTFE covered stent for the management of portal <br>hypertension in children. Covered stentgraft has been used to treat <br>TIPSS-biliary fistula and to revise previously malfunctioning shunt created <br>with a bare stent in 2 patients. Recently, Mermuys reported a good <br>medium-term patency of e-PTFE-covered stent TIPSS in 4 children. The <br>advantageous use of conventional covered Viatorr stent in children by <br>reducing the high rate of restenosis, reported up to 89% at 7 months, with <br>bare stent is counterbalanced by the required minimal diameter of the portal <br>vein and the nitinol skeleton which cannot be over dilated during the growth <br>of the liver. The improved medium- and long-term patency of e-PTFE covered <br>stent could avoid the need for repeated shunt revision under general <br>anesthesia and, in the case of stable liver function, liver transplantation <br>could be postponed or even cancelled, especially in case of acute or <br>subacute Budd-Chiari syndrome. Placement of a second parallel TIPSS in order <br>to accommodate the increased portal venous flow with growth may be an <br>alternative technique. 6. Children submitted to TIPSS should have close <br>follow-up including Doppler ultrasound at 1 day, 1 week, 3 months and then <br>at every 6-month interval, so that eventual stenosis or occlusion can be <br>diagnosed early. Oral <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> is recommended for at least 3 months, <br>and ideally maintained forever or until liver transplantation in case of <br>small TIPSS with diameter less than 8 mm. Results Published procedural <br>success rate in children ranges from 78 to 98% (80% after the first <br>attempt), lower than in adults (95%). Complication rates in children are <br>similar to those of adults except for an increase in the need for <br>endovascular reintervention to maintain mid- and long-term patency. This <br>fact results from small vessel size, from lower shunt diameter (6 to 9 in <br>children versus 9 to 12 in adults) and the preferential use of bare stent <br>instead of covered stent. Other expected complications of TIPSS in children <br>may be technical problems, such as intraperitoneal bleeding, biliary <br>fistula, injury to the vessels or inappropriate size during growth. Hepatic <br>encephalopathy appears to be less problematic in children (15%) than in <br>adults (20-30%). The reason for this difference is not clear but could be <br>related to more favourable circulatory or central nervous system adaptation <br>to the changes incurred by the procedure. To our knowledge, TIPSS placement <br>for the treatment of complication of portal hypertension in children has <br>been reported in 81 patients (7 series including 3 to 12 patients and 31 <br>case reports). Refractory or recurrent variceal bleeding is the primary <br>indication for portal decompression in more than 90%. The reported technical <br>success rate is 92, including the need for a second attempt in 11 patients. <br>The clinical success rate ranges between 86 and 93% in terms of controlling <br>variceal bleeding. Refractory ascites was improved in 75% of patients. <br>Thrombocytopenia due to severe hypersplenism is consistently improved in <br>only one-third of patients. This indication is still controversial. Early <br>stenosis or occlusion need reintervention during the first month in 25%. 88% <br>of children need reintervention during the first year follow-up. TIPSS <br>serves as a bridge to elective liver transplantation in 49 patients (61%). <br>No case of failed transplantation after TIPSS has yet been reported. <br>Improvement of general condition after TIPSS in 8 children with preserved <br>liver function has postponed or even obviated the need for transplantation. <br>The definitive management for children with cirrhosis is liver <br>transplantation. TIPSS placement provides a useful treatment bridge prior to <br>transplantation, allowing for improving nutrition thereby making the patient <br>a more suitable candidate for liver transplantation. However, the procedure <br>is more difficult than in adults, especially in children with biliary <br>atresia and/or advanced peri-portal fibrosis and the frequency of <br>reinterventions is higher compared with adults. The use of covered stent, <br>sometimes in combination with bare stents, seems feasible in children.<br><br>RECORD 533<br>Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO) of gastric <br>varices in three patients with <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span><br>Kim L.

Material and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed three patients <br>treated with BRTO of gastric varices from November 2009 to September 2010. <br>Three patients (one man and two women; mean age, 50 years; range, 35-64 <br>years) were analyzed in the study. Indication of BRTO of gastric varices <br>included iatrogenic complete <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>, complete portal vein <br>thrombosis from pancreatitis and partial <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> from Crohn's <br>disease. BRTO of gastric varices was performed in two patients due to prior <br>significant hematemesis and in one patient for prophylaxis due to continuing <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> medications. Technical and clinical success, and clinical <br>outcome were analyzed. Results: BRTO of gastric varices was successfully <br>performed in all patients without complications. Ethanolamine oleate was <br>used as a sclerosing agent in one patient and 3% sodium tetradecyl sulfate <br>(sotradecol) in two patients. Follow-up CT or MRI images (2-9 months) and <br>endoscopy showed obliteration of gastric varices in all patients.

Rossetto V. Radu C. Gavasso S. Burra P. Simioni P. Senzolo M.<br>Transplant International (2011) 24 SUPPL. 2 (143-144). Date of Publication: <br>September 2011<br><br>Introduction: Cirrhotics, including patients awaiting liver transplantation, <br>may present thrombotic complications such as <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>, that <br>warrant <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy to prevent extension into the splanchnic <br>vessels, which can jeopardize transplantation. However, due to the reset <br>hemostatic balance in cirrhotics, the anticoagulant effect of LMWH could <br>differ from the one expected. Aim: To evaluate in vitro the effect of LMWH <br>on TG in cirrhotics at different stages of liver disease with respect to <br>antithrombinIII (ATIII) levels. Methods: Thirty cirrhotics (10 ChildA, 10 <br>ChildB, 10 ChildC) without HCC or known thrombophylic genetic defects, 10 <br>type1-ATIII-defect patients, and 10 healthy subjects were included in the <br>study. ATIII activity was determined for every subject. TG on PPP, with <br>determination of endogenous thrombin potential (ETP), was performed at basal <br>conditions and with enoxaparin at 0.35UI/mL anti-Xa activity. The effect of <br>LMWH was expressed in terms of ETP ratio at 0.35UI/ML (0.35ETP ratio), and <br>was calculated by dividing ETP with LMWH by ETP in native plasma. Results: <br>Mean±SD ATIII activity levels in cirrhotics were 75±25%, 55.3±22%, and <br>41.1±13.6%, for Child A, B, and C patients, respectively, in contrast with <br>51±6.8% for ATIII-defect patients. The decrease in ATIII activity was <br>statistically significant in all cirrhotics compared to controls <br>(104.9±8.6%,p<.001). 0,35ETP ratio was significantly lower in cirrhotic <br>patients compared to controls (0.26±0.1 vs 0.48±0.1,p<.001), reduced <br>parallel to increasing disease severity. There was a direct correlation <br>between 0.35ETPratio and ATIII (r=.64,p=.001). Conclusions: Cirrhotic <br>patients show an increasing response to LMWH parallel to increasing severity <br>of liver disease, despite a decreasing level of ATIII.

Date of Publication: 15 Aug 2011<br><br>Background: Because myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) are a frequent cause <br>of Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS), treatment directed toward altering platelet <br>production and function may be more rational and effective than <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> after liver transplantation. Methods: We reviewed data on 25 <br>patients who received liver transplantation for BCS at our institution from <br>1987 to 2007. Posttransplant antithrombotic treatment was based on the cause <br>of BCS: 17 patients with MPDs received hydroxyurea/aspirin; 5 received <br>warfarin; and 3 (2 whose hypercoagulable disorder was corrected and 1 with <br>sarcoidosis) received no therapy. RESULTS.: Both graft survival (88% at 5 <br>years) and patient survival (92% at 5 years) were superior in the BCS group <br>compared with the 2609 patients who received liver transplants for other <br>indications. Vascular complications included three instances of hepatic <br>artery stenosis (NS compared with non-BCS liver recipients), one of portal <br>vein thrombosis (nonsignificant [NS]), and one of portal vein stenosis (NS). <br>All 25 patients underwent multiple liver biopsies with no bleeding <br>complications. Conclusions: Using hydroxyurea and aspirin to treat patients <br>with BCS caused by an MPD seems to be safe and effective and avoids the <br>risks of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> with warfarin. © 2011 by Lippincott Williams & <br>Wilkins.<br><br>RECORD 537<br>Menstrual problems and contraception in women of reproductive age receiving <br>oral <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span><br>Huq F.Y. Tvarkova K. Arafa A. Kadir R.A.<br>Contraception (2011) 84:2 (128-132). Date of Publication: August 2011<br><br>Background: Oral <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> is associated with increased bleeding <br>complications. The aim of this study was to assess the changes in menstrual <br>loss and pattern in women taking anticoagulant treatment. Study Design: <br>Women on oral anticoagulant (OA) treatment at the Royal Free Hospital were <br>interviewed and completed a questionnaire about their menstrual cycle before <br>and after commencing oral <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> treatment. They were then asked to <br>complete a pictorial bleeding assessment chart (PBAC) during their next <br>menstrual bleeding episode. Results: Fifty-three women between the ages of <br>20 and 50 years participated in the study. Of these, 47 women completed a <br>PBAC. The mean duration of menstruation increased from 5 days before <br>starting OA therapy to 7 days after the commencement of treatment. <br>Thirty-one (66%) of the 47 women who completed the PBAC had a score that was <br>greater than 100. The number of women who experienced flooding or clots <br>during menstruation and intermenstrual or postcoital bleeding also <br>increased. In total, 29 (54.7%) women changed their method of contraception <br>during OA treatment. Seventeen women who did not want to become pregnant <br>were not using contraception, including 10 women who were on hormonal <br>contraception prior to starting anticoagulant therapy. Conclusion: Women of <br>reproductive age experience heavy and prolonged menstrual bleeding whilst on <br>OA therapy. Women of reproductive age on OA therapy should be monitored for <br>menstrual disorders to ensure that prompt and appropriate treatment is <br>instituted. Advice about appropriate contraception should also be part of <br>the medical care provided for these women. Barrier contraception, <br>sterilization and progestin-only contraception are all suitable methods of <br>contraception in this patient group. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Kopac D. Brisebois R. Sample C. Shapiro A.M.J.<br>Canadian Journal of Surgery (2011) 54:4 (227-231). Date of Publication: <br>August 2011<br><br>Background: Splenic and <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (S<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is a potentially <br>lifethreatening complication of splenectomy. There is a paucity of studies <br>examining the role of prophylactic pre- and postoperative <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in <br>the prevention of this complication. We designed a prospective randomized <br>controlled trial (RCT) to more rigorously address the impact of prophylactic <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> on the incidence of asymptom atic or symptomatic S<span style="color: red">PVT</span>, <br>detected on Doppler ultrasound, after lapa - roscopic splenectomy. Methods: <br>This 2-centre, phase II, prospective, open-label, parallel-assignment RCT <br>compared no postoperative <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> to a regimen of 40 mg of <br>enoxaparin subcutaneously once daily for 21 days. All patients underwent <br>Doppler ultrasonography of the splenoportal system preoperatively and again <br>14-28 days after surgery to screen for nonocclusive or occlusive thrombosis. <br>Results: From November 2006 to November 2008, 35 patients were enrolled in <br>the RCT. Four patients withdrew, 1 required conversion to an open procedure <br>and 1 died at 3 months (the cause of death was not related to the study). Of <br>the 29 patients remaining, 15 were randomly assigned to the <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>group and 14 to the non<span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> group. One (3.4%) patient in the <br>treatment group experienced portal thrombosis. Rates of postoperative <br>bleeding were similar in both groups. Conclusion: This RCT of <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> found a low overall risk of S<span style="color: red">PVT</span> after laparoscopic <br>splenectomy; however, this is an underpowered study, and further <br>multicentred clinical trials are needed. © 2011 Canadian Medical <br>Association.<br><br>RECORD 539<br>Impact of pre-transplant liver hemodynamics and portal reconstruction <br>techniques on post-transplant portal vein complications in pediatric liver <br>transplantation: A retrospective analysis in 197 recipients<br>De Magnée C. Bourdeaux C. De Dobbeleer F. Janssen M. Menten R. Clapuyt P. <br>Reding R.<br>Annals of Surgery (2011) 254:1 (55-61). Date of Publication: July 2011<br><br>Background and Objective: Portal vein (PV) complications are the most <br>frequent vascular complications in pediatric liver transplant (LT). We <br>hypothesized that pre-LT liver hemodynamic parameters and PV reconstruction <br>technique could predict the risk of PV complications post-LT. Methods: Three <br>hundred seventy-three children had a primary LT. A detailed ultrasound study <br>of the pre-LT native liver hemodynamics was available in 198 cases, with <br>details of PV anastomosis available for 197 of these: end-to-end anastomosis <br>(n = 146, 74%), interposition vein graft technique (n = 28, 14%), or <br>portoplasty (latero-lateral anastomosis of vein graft and recipient PV) (n = <br>23, 12%). Results: Overall 5-year patient survival rate was 90%. Among the <br>198 patients with pre-LT hemodynamic data, 79 (40%) had PV hypoplasia <br>(diameter ≤4 mm), 64 (32%) had a pathological portal flow (nonhepatopetal <br>flow), and 47 (24%) had an arterial resistance index (ARI) ≥1. Abnormal <br>hemodynamics were mostly observed in biliary atresia (BA). Among these 3 <br>parameters, only ARI ≥1 was significantly correlated with a higher rate of <br>PV complications post-LT (P = 0.041). PV complication-free survival at 5 <br>years were 91% for end-to-end anastomosis, 91% for portoplasty, and 62% for <br>interposition vein graft technique (P = 0.002). At multivariate analysis, <br>the use of an interposition vein graft was the only factor to be <br>significantly associated with a higher rate of PV complications post-LT (P = <br>0.003). Conclusions: PV hypoplasia with liver hemodynamic disturbances was <br>mainly observed in BA. Hepatic ARI ≥1 might be a good predictor of PV <br>complications post-LT. Latero-lateral portoplasty seemed to provide the best <br>results when end-to-end anastomosis is not feasible.

We aimed to <br>prospectively evaluate the use of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> and transjugular <br>intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), as a second line option, to treat <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Methods: Patients with cirrhosis and with non malignant <span style="color: red">PVT</span> were <br>included. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> with LWMH was considered in all; TIPS was <br>indicated if there was a concomitant of portal hypertensive complication, or <br>if thrombosis progressed. Patients seen in the same period, but who were not <br>anticoagulated neither received TIPS, were included as controls. Results: <br>Fifty-six patients were included (21 were controls). In the study group, <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>was occlusive in 11/35 with extension to the superior mesenteric vein or <br>splenic vein in 13/35. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was initiated in 33 patients. Mean <br>follow-up ± SD was 21.6 ± 8.5 and 24.5 ± 8.2 months for study and control <br>groups, respectively. Complete recanalization rate was 36% (12/33) in the <br>treatment group compared to one among controls (P < 0.001). A short time <br>interval between appearance of thrombosis and <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> (< 6 months) <br>strongly predicted chance of repermeation. During the follow-up there was <br>progression of thrombosis in 15/21 who were not anticoagulated and in 5/33 <br>anticoagulated patients (P < 0.001). TIPS was placed in six patients. There <br>were five patients with variceal bleeding and two intestinal venous infarcts <br>in the control group, compared to one variceal bleeding episode in the study <br>group. Conclusions: A treatment algorithm with <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> and the use <br>of TIPS in patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and cirrhosis achieved a good chance of <br>complete repermeation, reduced portal hypertensive complications and <br>decreased the rate of thrombosis progression.

Measurements and Main Results. Medical claims data <br>compared were direct <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> cost and overall medical care costs, <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>-related adverse events, hospitalizations and emergency <br>department visits, frequency of international normalized ratio (INR) <br>testing, and quantity of warfarin refills. Operational costs of the <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> service were also calculated. The INR values and time within <br>therapeutic range were assessed through <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> service reports and <br>laboratory results. The direct <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> care cost was $35,465 versus <br>$111,586 and the overall medical care cost was $754,191 versus $1,480,661 <br>for the <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> service group versus the usual care group. <br>Accounting for operational and drug expenditure costs, the cost savings was <br>$647,024 for the <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> service group. The <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> service <br>group had significantly fewer <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>-related adverse events (14 vs <br>41, p<0.0001), hospital admissions (3 vs 14, p<0.00001), and emergency <br>department visits (58 vs 134, p<0.00001). The percentage of INR values in <br>range and the percentage of time the INR values were in range were <br>significantly higher in the <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> service group (67.2% vs 54.6%, <br>p<0.0001, and 73.7% vs 61.3%, p<0.0001, respectively).

Our aim was <br>to study the outcome of patients who underwent splenectomy at LTX. Data for <br>2603 adult LTX recipients at one institution from 1985-2008 were reviewed <br>retrospectively; 69 underwent splenectomy at with LTX (2.7%). Liver disease <br>etiology showed that splenectomized patients had more autoimmune disease <br>(11.6% vs 3.8%), less hepatitis C (26.1% vs 36.2%) and less Laennec <br>cirrhosis (4,4% vs 12.4%) than non-spienectomized patients (p=0.GO74). <br>Kaplan Meier patient and graft survivals were not statistically different (p <br>0.1833 and p 0.0857, respectively).

Since <br>coagulation examinations were almost normal, and there was no past history <br>of <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> or malignancy, it was diagnosed to be portal vein <br>thrombosis (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) associated with ischemic colitis. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy <br>was initiated for <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. According to the results of the US and abdominal <br>computed tomography performed 3 months after starting the treatment, <br>thrombus in the right branch had diminished but remained in the umbilical <br>region of the left branch.

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2011<br><br>Background. Myeloproliferative diseases(MPDs) are shown to have an increased <br>risk of thrombotic complications such as splachnic vein thrombosis( <br>SVT).Mutations on JAK2 pathway are thought to play key role on such <br>thrombotic complications. Aims. The focus of the current work is to evaluate <br>the risk of SVT in MPDs patients and its colleration with the mutation <br>JAK2V617F. Methods. Patients with non-cirrhotic, non-cancer related SVT and <br>with clinical or laborating findings suggesting MPD were assessed for the <br>presence of JAK2V617F mutation. We suspected that normal or light increased <br>platelet count might mask MPDs (portal hypertension-hypersplenism, occult <br>bleeding).Assessment for hematological pro-coagulant conditions included <br>factor V Leiden, antithrombin III, protein C, protein S, homocysteine, MTHFR <br>mutation, prothrombin gene mutation PT20210A, anticardiolipin antibodies and <br>lupus anticoagulant. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria was screened using <br>standard flow cytometry techniques. Patients with known history of <br>pylephlebitis were excluded. SVT was confirmed with computerized tomography <br>and abdominal doppler ultrasound. SVT was characterized as chronic if there <br>was evidence of intra-abdominal venous collaterals, carvenous transformation <br>of the portal vein, or signs of portal hypertension. 4.Results:In the study <br>14 patients were included. The median age at the time of diagnosis was 50.71 <br>years (range, 21-78) and 57% were male.

Non-neoplastic chronic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is a <br>frecuent diagnosis in the course of <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span>, with reported <br>prevalences of 0.6% to 15,8%. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> can motivate life-threatening <br>complications due to worsening portal hypertension, so <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>therapy is challenging in these patients. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the response <br>to antithrombotic therapy and changes in liver function tests in 28 patients <br>with chronic <span style="color: red">PVT</span> associated with cirrhosis. Patients and Methods. 28 <br>consecutive patients with <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span> and chronic <span style="color: red">PVT</span> were treated with <br>antithrombotic therapy from 2004 to 2009. Hepatocellular carcinoma and known <br>thrombophilic risks were ruled out. Therapy consisted in 15 days of <br>therapeutic doses of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) (enoxaparin) <br>adjusted according to baseline coagulability (Table 1), followed by either <br>prophylactic doses (40mg/day) of LMWH or acenocoumarol (target INR 2-3), <br>during 6 months. Response was evaluated after 6 months. (Table presented) If <br>recanalization was complete, therapy was suspended. If recanalization was <br>partial or no recanalization was observed, therapy was continued until <br>response. RESULTS: From the 28 patients studied, 19 (68%) were males with a <br>median age of 53 years (range 35-77). Cirrhosis was due to alcoholism (25%), <br>virus (54%), mixed in 1 patient and other causes in 3 patients. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> involved <br>the portal trunk and/or branches in 19/28 (68%) patients, mesenteric vein in <br>2 patients and portal trunk and/or branches, mesenteric and/or splenic vein <br>thrombosis coexisted in 7 patients. 19/28 (68%) of the patients had moderate <br>or moderate-severe hypocoagulability range. Complete and partial thrombosis <br>was seen in 18 and 10 patients at diagnosis, respectively. From the 28 <br>patients, 18 (64%) responded to antithrombotic therapy after 6 months, with <br>a complete recanalization in 13 patients 13/18 (72%) and partial in 5/18 <br>patients (28%). None of the 28 patients presented hemorrhagic complications <br>and none showed platelets counts below baseline values. 17 from the 18 <br>patients who responded, showed altered liver function tests before therapy. <br>After 6 months, 8/17 (47%) improved liver function (only one patient had <br>received antiviral therapy). After a median follow up of 42 months (range <br>7-67), 15/18 (83%) patients continued showing complete or partial response <br>while 3 patients progressed. Of note, 3 patients of this group could proceed <br>to further liver transplantation. Conclusions: Antithrombotic therapy in <br>chronic <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in cirrhotic patients resulted in a high response rate (64%) in <br>our study, with a complete recanalization in 72% of the cases. Adjusted dose <br>scheme according to level of hypocoagulability seems to be effective and <br>safe, since 63% of the subgroups of moderate and moderate-severe <br>hypocoagulability responded with no haemorrhagic complications.<br><br>RECORD 549<br>Abdominal venous thrombosis following inflammatory bowel disease related <br>surgeries while on dalteparin prophylaxis. Case series<br>Naik A.S. Zadvornova Y. Lundeen S.J. Stein D.J. Venu N. Otterson M.F. Issa <br>M. Perera L.P.<br>Gastroenterology (2011) 140:5 SUPPL. 1 (S432). Date of Publication: May 2011<br><br>INTRODUCTION: Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), including <br>Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), are at increased risk for <br>venous thrombosis (VT). VT occurs more often in the deep veins of leg and <br>pulmonary circulation, but has been described to occur less frequently in <br>other sites including: portal vein and mesenteric veins. We report a case <br>series of post-operative abdominal VT following a switch in Low Molecular <br>Weight Heparin (LMWH) VT prophylaxis preparations from enoxaparin (EP) to <br>dalteparin (DP) on 10/11/09 in our tertiary referral center. METHODS: A <br>retrospective review of consecutive IBD patients undergoing IBD related <br>surgery performed by a single surgeon at our IBD center between 2008-2010 <br>was performed. We recorded all surgeries 1 year before and after (LMWH) <br>switch. We collected surgical reports and VT prophylaxis of all cases, and <br>investigated rate of abdominal VT events. Events were diagnosed on CT of <br>abdomen and pelvis performed in response to a change in clinical status (i.e <br>abdominal pain, fever and elevated white cell count). RESULTS: A total of <br>131 IBD-related surgeries were performed, all of whom received VT <br>prophylaxis with LMWH. We identified 72 surgeries (55 small bowel <br>resections, 16 colectomies, 1 J pouch excision) in the EP group and 59 <br>surgeries (40 small bowel resections, 19 colectomies) in the DP group. There <br>were 7 cases of post-operative abdominal VT in the DP group, (3 males and 4 <br>females) compared to 0 cases in the EP group (p< 0.02; Fischer's Exact). <br>Mean disease duration was 52 mo (range 1- 126 mo). 6/ 7 (86%) patients on <br>oral steroids (5 patients on prednisone [mean 40mg (range 20-60mg)] and 1 <br>patient on entocort (9mg) prior to surgery. One female patient had a known <br>antithrombin III mutation for which DP dosing guidelines were followed. Only <br>2/7 patients were actively smoking at the time of surgery. Surgery types in <br>the VT group were total abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy (1 <br>laparoscopic, 3 open; 1 CD and 3 UC); and small bowel resections for <br>stricturing CD (n=3). VT locations were 4 pts with <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>, 2 <br>patients with superior mesenteric vein thrombosis and 1 pt with both veins <br>involved. In VT cases, 5 patients were on biologics, 4 patients were on <br>immunomodulators, and 3 patients were on 5-ASA products. CONCLUSIONS: Our <br>series shows alarming numbers of abdominal VT in the post-operative period <br>following IBD-related surgeries while on appropriate VT prophylaxis dosing <br>with DP. Reasons for inadequate <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> may be either inappropriate <br>dosing or differences in anticoagulant effect as minor differences do exist <br>between DP and EP. It is unclear if this is an IBD-related phenomenon. We <br>suggest further investigation of this phenomenon and caution with DP use for <br>VT prophylaxis in pre-operative IBD patients. .<br><br>RECORD 550<br>Acute portomesenteric venous thrombosis following abdominal surgery: <br>Observe, anticoagulate or operate?<br>Leonardi M.J.

Date of Publication: <br>May 2011<br><br>Background: Portomesenteric venous thrombosis (PMVT) is a rare, but serious, <br>complication of abdominal surgery with no agreed standard of care. <br>Management options include observation, <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, and thrombectomy. <br>Our study aims to characterize a large series of patients with PMVT after <br>abdominal surgery with a focus on management and outcomes. Methods: <br>Weperformed a retrospective analysis of more than 4000 patients having <br>abdominal surgery at an academic medical center between January 2007 and <br>August 2010. Patients with postoperative thrombosis of the portal, superior <br>mesenteric, and/or splenic veins were reviewed. Transplant patients and <br>those with preexisting PMVT were excluded. The diagnosis was established by <br>computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and/ or duplex <br>ultrasound. Results: Forty-four patients had PMVT (23 isolated portal, 19 <br>combined portal and mesenteric and/or splenic, 1 isolated mesenteric, 1 <br>isolated splenic). Average patient age was 59 years, and 55% were male. Four <br>patients (9%) were on preoperative <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> that was held for <br>surgery, and 25 patients (57%) had a malignancy. Operations performed <br>included pancreas resection (21), liver resection (5), colorectal resection <br>(5), pancreas debridement (4), splenectomy (3), major biliary surgery (2), <br>combined pancreas and colon resection (2), palliative gastrojejunostomy (1), <br>gastrectomy (1), and abdominal wall reconstruction (1). Median time from <br>operation to PMVT diagnosis was 14 days, and 23 patients were diagnosed <br>after discharge from the original hospitalization. Diagnostic modalities <br>included computed tomography (35), duplex ultrasound (8), and magnetic <br>resonance imaging (1). Treatment included observation in 15 patients, <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in 24 patients (20 continued as outpatients), and operative <br>thrombectomy in 5 patients. All patients who underwent operative <br>thrombectomy developed PMVT on postoperative day 1 after their initial <br>operation, and four of these patients had a portomesenteric venous resection <br>and reconstruction as part of their initial operation. PMVT-induced liver <br>abscess occurred in 1 patient. Small bowel and/or colon resection for <br>ischemia occurred in 2 patients. Seventeen (40%) patients were readmitted <br>within 30 days of discharge from the PMVT admission. Only one patient died <br>five days after a liver resection complicated by <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> <br>requiring operative thrombectomy and enterectomy. Conclusions: <br>Portomesenteric venous thrombosis (PMVT) is an uncommon complication <br>following abdominal surgery which may present early postoperatively, but <br>often presents after discharge. While the morbidity associated with PMVT is <br>high, the mortality is low (2%). Management should be tailored to individual <br>patient characteristics with respect to timing and severity of presentation.<br><br>RECORD 551<br>Hypercoaguable state<br>Sturtevant A.<br>Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011) 26 SUPPL. 1 (S377-S378).

CASE <br>INFORMATION: A 63 year-old woman presentedcomplaining of a five day history <br>of intermittent sharp 10/10 epigastric painthat is worse after eating. <br>Herabdomen was slightly tender to palpation and there was no hepatomegaly, <br>splenomegaly,distension, ascites, or lower extremity edema.

The spleen was moderately <br>enlarged. IMPLICATIONS/DISCUSSION: General internists frequentlyencounter <br>patients with thrombosis and face the dilemma of when to pursue afull <br>hypercoagulability workup. There is not a firm concensus regarding which <br>patients to screen, butpatients with identifiable risk factors for <br>thrombosis such as SLE, prolonged periods of inactivity, malignancy, recent <br>surgery, myeloproliferative disorder,Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, <br>preeclampsia should not be screened. Screening should be undertaken <br>inpatients if the patient has family history of thromboses in first <br>degreerelatives; if the patient is younger than 50; the patient has <br>recurrentthrombosis; a history of warfarin induced skin necrosis or if the <br>patient hasunusual or extensive thromboses such as the portal vein (without <br>anidentifiable precipitating cause). Once a decision to test for an <br>underlying disorder has been made, it isimportant to consider which tests <br>can be performed in the acute phase and on<span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. <br>Antiphospholipidantibodies (lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibody, <br>and anti-B2glycoprotein), Factor V Leiden,and Prothrombin gene mutation can <br>be screened for in the acute phase prior tostarting <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. <br>Lupusanticoagulant should not be measured after starting heparin therapy <br>orCoumadin. Other testing such asantithrombin deficiency, Factor VIII, <br>Protein C and Protein S should not bemeasured until after the patient is out <br>of the acute phase (generally 6 months)and off therapy. Age <br>appropriatecancer screening should also be performed. When making the <br>decision to perform testing for ahypercoagulable state internists should <br>consider the appropriateness, timing, and the effect a positive test would <br>have on the choice and duration of therapy.<br><br>RECORD 552<br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> following laparoscopic cholecystectomy complicated by <br>dengue viral infection: A case report<br>Dan D.

Although therapeutic <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> is recommended, this treatment may be questionable when the <br>patient has an associated bleeding diathesis. Case presentation. We report a <br>case of a 63-year-old woman of Asian Indian ethnicity who developed portal <br>vein thrombosis following an uneventful laparoscopic cholecystectomy for <br>symptomatic gallstones. Her condition was further complicated by dengue <br>viral infection in the post-operative period, with thrombocytopenia <br>immediately preceding the diagnosis of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. The <br>etiological connections between dengue viral infection with <br>thrombocytopenia, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> as <br>well as the treatment dilemmas posed in treating a patient with portal vein <br>thrombosis with a bleeding diathesis are discussed. Conclusion: When portal <br>vein thrombosis occurs in patients with contraindications to <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, there is a role for initial conservative management without <br>aggressive <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy and such patients must be approached on <br>an individualized basis. © 2011 Dan et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.<br><br>RECORD 553<br>Thromboembolism in inflammatory bowel disease: An insidious association <br>requiring a high degree of vigilance<br>Di Fabio F. Lykoudis P. Gordon P.H.<br>Seminars in Thrombosis and Hemostasis (2011) 37:3 (220-225). Date of <br>Publication: 2011<br><br>Venous and arterial thromboembolism are both serious extraintestinal <br>manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Acquired risk factors <br>seem to play a more prominent role than congenital in promoting thrombotic <br>events. Prevention of thromboembolism is thus mainly aimed at minimizing the <br>acquired/reversible risk factors (e.g., inflammation, immobility, <br>hospitalization, steroid therapy, central intravenous catheters, smoking, <br>oral contraceptives, and deficiency of B vitamins and folate). The diagnosis <br>of venous and arterial thromboembolism is extremely challenging and requires <br>a high degree of vigilance. Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism may <br>be clinically silent or manifest with only few specific symptoms. Thrombosis <br>of the portal vein system may occur with nonspecific symptoms such as <br>abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, abdominal tenderness, ascites, and fever. <br>The diagnosis of arterial thromboembolism may also be challenging, <br>particularly when the splanchnic region is involved. Indeed, arterial <br>thrombosis of the splanchnic region tends to be overlooked and <br>misinterpreted as a clinical exacerbation of IBD. Early diagnosis plays a <br>central role in optimizing the therapeutic intervention and reducing the <br>risk of short-term and long-term thrombosis-associated complications.

Percutaneous transhepatic <br>portal access avoids surgery, but is rarely associated with bleeding or <br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. Herein, we evaluate factors affecting portal <br>pressure and risk factors of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> post islet <br>transplantation. Methods: We reviewed records of 278 intraportal islet <br>transplant procedures in 127 patients (mean 2.19 infusions/patient). Portal <br>venous pressure (mmHg) was measured by using a pressure transducer before <br>and after completion of islet infusion. A doppler ultrasound was performed <br>in 24 hours post transplantation for all cases to assess the complications <br>such as <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>, hematoma or bleeding routinely. Results: The <br>mean islet mass was 407,221 IE (5,908 IE/kg) with mean packed cell volume of <br>4.1 mL (range: 1.5 - 7.9). Institution of therapeutic heparinization, <br>effective catheter tract ablation with Avitene paste, and limiting packed <br>cell volume to <5 mL has completely prevented this complication in 101 islet <br>transplant procedures over the past 4.3 years. Univariate analysis revealed <br>that standard liver volume correlated negatively with portal pressure rise <br>(r=-0.257, P<0.01), with a larger liver volume experiencing less <br>perturbation in portal pressure. Packed cell volume correlated positively <br>with elevated portal pressure (r=0.463, P<0.01). Ten patients (3.6%) <br>developed partial thrombosis of the intrahepatic portal vein (none since <br>August 2006). Univariate analysis revealed that both portal pressure <br>elevation (r=0.256, P<0.0001) and high packed cell volume (r=0.161, P<0.01) <br>were risk factors for thrombosis. Packed cell volume <5.5 mL (sensitivity <br>50%, specificity 84.5%) and portal pressure rise <4.5 mmHg (sensitivity 70%, <br>specificity 73.2%) were founded to be cut offs to prevent portal vein <br>thrombosis. Conclusions: Portal thrombosis is a preventable complication in <br>clinical islet transplantation, provided therapeutic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> is <br>maintained, and packed cell volume is limited to <5 mL.<br><br>RECORD 555<br>Outcome for patients who undergo splenectomy at the time of liver <br>transplantation<br>Onaca N.

Date of <br>Publication: April 2011<br><br>Splenectomy is performed selectively at the time of liver transplantation <br>for various indications. Concerns with splenectomized patients in general <br>include <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>, other thrombotic events, and infectious <br>complications including overwhelming sepsis. Our aim was to study the <br>outcome of patients who underwent splenectomy at the time of liver <br>transplantation. Data for 2603 adult patients who underwent liver <br>transplantation at a single institution between 1985-2008 were reviewed <br>retrospectively. 69 patients underwent splenectomy at the time of <br>transplantation (2.7%). Liver disease etiology showed that splenectomized <br>patients, when compared to non-splenectomized patients, had more autoimmune <br>disease (11.6% vs. 3.8%), less hepatitis C (26.1% vs 36.2%) and less Laennec <br>cirrhosis (4.4% vs 12.4%)(p=0.0074). Kaplan Meier patient and graft <br>survivals were not statistically different (p=0.1833 and p=0.0857, <br>respectively). There was no significant difference at all time intervals <br>posttransplant in the incidence of acute cellular rejection (p=0.81-0.9) and <br>of steroid-resistant rejection (p=0.13- 0.19) between groups. The overall <br>incidence of infections, including septic shock, was not significantly <br>different. However, splenectomized patients had significantly more hepatic <br>abscesses (10.1% vs 2.6%, p=0.0027), urinary tract infections at all times <br>posttransplant (30.4% vs 18.7%, p=0.0192), and pancreatitis (11.6% vs 5%) <br>than patients without splenectomy. Thrombotic complications were more <br>frequent in splenectomized patients: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (14.5% vs 2.4%, <br>p<0.0001), deep venous thrombosis (10.1% vs 4.1%, p=0.0258), and pulmonary <br>embolism (4.4% vs 1.1%, p=0.0511). <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> occurred within 3 <br>months from transplant in non-splenectomized patients, while it occurred <br>both earlier and later than 3 months in splenectomized patients.

Date of Publication: April 2011<br><br>Introduction: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) and mesenteric venous thrombosis <br>(MVT) are uncommon disease entities in adults. In a minority of cases, <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>and MVT lead to acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI). Little is known about the <br>clinical importance of this complication in thrombotic patients. The aim of <br>this study was to describe clinical outcomes and risk factors in patients <br>with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and/or MVT complicated by AMI. Methods: Hospital records and <br>clinical data of all patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and/or MVT between 1995 and 2010 were <br>reviewed. Clinical features, laboratory findings, etiologic factors, and <br>treatment modalities were recorded and assessed as possible risk factors for <br>mortality. All deaths within 30 days of the start of treatment <br>(surgery/<span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>) were considered to represent mortality. Results: <br>Twenty-eight patients (16 male, 12 female) were identified as having <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>and/or MVT using ultrasound or CT scan. Clinical outcomes of 9 out of 28 <br>(32%) patients were complicated by acute mesenteric ischemia. One out of <br>these 9 patients underwent an explorative laparotomy, 7 underwent bowel <br>resection without revascularisation, and one patient was treated <br>conservatively with <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. In those patients complicated by acute <br>mesenteric ischemia, none demonstrated pre-existent coagulopathies, whereas <br>those patients not complicated by AMI demonstrated preexistent <br>coagulopathies in 25% of cases. Patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> or MVT undergoing surgery <br>for mesenteric ischemia demonstrated a 30-day mortality rate of 25%, whereas <br>patients without mesenteric ischemia all survived 30 days after <br>anticoagulatory treatment.

Date of <br>Publication: April 2011<br><br>Background: In the past, complete <span style="color: red">PVT</span> had been considered an absolute <br>contraindication to OLT. The purpose of this report was to analyze our <br>experience in the management of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> during OLT and to evaluate its effect on <br>outcomes. Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients <br>with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> transplanted between January 2006 to October 2010.Imaging was <br>reviewed and patients were determined to have either partial or complete <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>involving the main portal vein. Age, gender, and MELD score matched controls <br>were selected for comparison.Outcome measures including operative time, <br>number of units of PRBCs required during OLT, graft and patient survival <br>were analyzed. The use of modified surgical technique, presence of a defined <br>hypercoagulable state, and use of post transplant <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> or <br>antiplatelet therapy were also recorded. Results: Of 408 patients who <br>underwent OLT,18 patients(4.4%) were found to have pretransplant <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Three <br>patients were excluded due to lack of available follow-up data. Baseline <br>parameters including age, gender, MELD score, were similar between the two <br>groups. Median follow-up was 429 d in the <span style="color: red">PVT</span> group and 300 d in the control <br>group. 12 of 15 patients in the <span style="color: red">PVT</span> group had partial thrombosis while the <br>other 3 had complete thrombosis. Surgical technique was modified in 8 <br>patients(53%). Antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy was used in 8 patients <br>post transplant with aspirin as the most commonly used agent. Mean operative <br>time was 509 min and 481 min in the <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and control groups(p=0.51). The mean <br>volume of PRBCs transfused intaoperatively was 9.2 units and 5.3 units in <br>the 2 groups(p=0.21).When comparing all patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> to controls we <br>found no effect of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> on patient or graft survival. 2 patients(13.3%) with <br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> died intraoperatively while no patients in the <br>control group died (p=0.14).

Date of Publication: March 2011<br><br>Background & Aims: Previous studies on obliterative portal venopathy (OPV) <br>have been biased due to the selection of patients with non-cirrhotic portal <br>hypertension. The aim of this study was to clarify the characteristics of <br>OVP diagnosed by liver biopsy. Methods: Fifty-nine consecutive patients with <br>OPV were retrospectively selected on strict histological criteria. Clinical, <br>laboratory, portal vein patency, and associated disorders potentially <br>involving vascular alterations were analyzed. The occurrence of <br>complications was recorded during follow-up. Results: Mean age at diagnosis <br>was 38.5 ± 15 years old. Initial presentation was portal hypertension (64% <br>of patients) and/or extrahepatic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (EH<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) (22%) or <br>isolated abnormal laboratory tests (20%). Associated diseases found at <br>diagnosis were: prothrombotic disorders (30% of patients) and <br>immune-mediated disorders (17%); 53% of patients had no causal factor <br>(idiopathic OPV). During follow-up (median 8.6 years, range 1-23 years), <br>features of portal hypertension worsened in 46% of patients; EH<span style="color: red">PVT</span> and <br>portal hypertension were finally found in 44% and 88% of patients. <br>Anti-coagulation and beta-blockers were administered in 47% and 59% of <br>patients, respectively. Severe complications (liver transplantation and/or <br>death) occurred in 11 (19%) patients, 8 had idiopathic OPV. Patients with <br>prothrombotic disorders received earlier <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy; all <br>survived without transplantation. Conclusions: A confident diagnosis of OPV <br>can be done by biopsy and is conceivable in patients under 40 years without <br>clinically significant portal hypertension.

Date of Publication: March 2011<br><br>Islet transplantation improves glycemic control in type1 diabetes <br>complicated by refractory hypoglycemia. Percutaneous transhepatic portal <br>access avoids surgery, but is rarely associated with bleeding or portal <br>venous thrombosis. Here, we evaluate factors affecting portal pressure and <br>thrombosis after islet infusion. 116 patients underwent 256 percutaneous <br>intraportal islet-alone transplant procedures (mean 2.16 infusions/ <br>patient). The mean islet mass was 407,221 IE (5,908 IE/ kg) with mean packed <br>cell volume (PCV) of 4.1 ml (1.5- 7.9). Univariate analysis revealed that <br>standard liver volume had a negative correlation with portal pressure <br>elevation (r = -0.257, P < 0.01), and those with larger liver volume had <br>less perturbation in portal venous pressure. PCV correlated positively with <br>elevated portal pressure (r = 0.463, P < 0.01). 10 patients (3.9%) developed <br>partial thrombosis of peripheral segmental branches of the intrahepatic <br>portal vein. None had complete portal thrombosis. Multivariable logistic <br>regression revealed that only elevated portal pressure was associated with <br>portal thrombosis (Odds Ratio 1.16, P = 0.045), but not PCV nor actual <br>number of islets infused. Of note, we have not encountered this complication <br>in the past 5 years, since institution of full heparin <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>protocols combined with effective avitene-paste plugging of the transhepatic <br>tract, and limitation in PCV to less than 5 ml.

Date of Publication: <br>March 2011<br><br>Background and aim: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is a well recognized and <br>frequent complication in advanced cirrhosis but is rare in a previously <br>healthy liver. Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are characterised by a <br>hypercoagulable state and by a higher incidence of systemic thromboembolic <br>events than in the general population. Material and methods: We describe the <br>presentation, diagnostic approaches, underlying acquired or inherited risks <br>factors for hypercoagulability and clinical outcome of 7 IBD patients <br>followed in our centre who developed <span style="color: red">PVT</span> during their clinical course. <br>Results: The patients (5 males; mean age: 47.7±11.1) presented with partial <br>PV thrombosis (4 patients) or portal cavernoma. Five had Crohn's disease <br>(CD) and two had ulcerative colitis (UC). Three CD patients had undergone <br>ileocolic resection for strictures and 1 UC patient had undergone colectomy. <br>One patient had HBV-positive active hepatitis and, in 2 patients, a <br>primitive sclerosing cholangitis was diagnosed during diagnostic work-up of <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Mean time from diagnosis of IBD to detection of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was 15.7±6.4 years. <br>In 4 patients, the diagnosis of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was made while IBD was in clinical <br>remission. No patient showed specific signs or symptoms leading to diagnosis <br>of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, which was initially made by ultrasound with colour Doppler in 6 <br>patients and by CT scan in one patient. Most patients showed at least 1 <br>potential risk factor for hypercoagulability: lupus anti-coagulant and <br>protein S deficiency were detected in one patient, 2 patients had von <br>Willebrand factor impairment and 2 patients increased homocysteine <br>levels.None of the patients received <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> following diagnosis of <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span> and none experienced other thrombotic events during a median of 5 years <br>(range 2-8 years). Conclusions: <span style="color: red">PVT</span> may be a potential complication of IBD, <br>frequently associated with underlying acquired or inherited risks factors <br>for hypercoagulability, but not necessarily with active disease.

Material and methods: Seventy-nine patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> seen from <br>January 2009 to December 2010 were included. Screening for thrombophilic <br>factorswas performed in 77 and all patients were evaluated for anticoagulant <br>therapy. Results: In 68 patients <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was associated with cirrhosis (86%) and <br>hepatocellular carcinoma (57%). <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was present in 26 patients (38%) despite <br>standard coagulation tests showing pro-haemorrhagic state. Thrombophilic <br>disorders was observed in 15 of cirrhotic patients (22%) vs 81% of <br>noncirrhotics.Forthy-six patients received low molecular weight heparin <br>(LMWH, 100 UI/kg/bd) or oral anticoagulant.

In this series, the Authors <br>report their incidence in laparoscopic splenectomy and therapeutic <br>strategies. Methods: Between 1998 and 2009, 102 patients were submitted to <br>laparoscopic splenectomy for hematologic disease. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was evaluated <br>clinically and diagnosed by means of abdominal computed tomography. Results: <br>Clinically evident <span style="color: red">PVT</span> has been diagnosed in 3 patients treated by <br>laparoscopic splenectomy affected by lymphoma (2 cases) and b-thalassemia (1 <br>case). Treatment of these patients was successfully obtained by conservative <br>therapy with high dose of heparin for at least 3 weeks.

Magini G. Burroughs A. Agazzi R. Colledan M. Zanus G. Gaffuri G. <br>Fagiuoli S.<br>Journal of Hepatology (2011) 54 SUPPL. 1 (S226-S227). Date of Publication: <br>March 2011<br><br>Background and Aims: TIPS has demonstrated a low rate of efficacy in LT <br>recipients compared to cirrhotic patients and the need for its placement <br>confers very poor survival without retransplantation. However, previous <br>studies have evaluated mainly patients with recurrence of primary liver <br>disease. The aim of our study was to compared the efficacy and outcome of <br>TIPS in LT recipients with portal hypertension due to recurrence of primary <br>liver disease, with patients in whom TIPS was indicated to treat vascular <br>complications. Methods: We evaluated the LT recipients in two transplant <br>centers who were referred for TIPS placement between October 2006 and August <br>2010. Efficacy of the procedure and outcome were analyzed with respect to <br>the underlying aetiology and severity of liver disease. Results: 13 patients <br>had an indication for TIPS placement (10M/3F, age 24-64 years), in 11 for <br>refractory ascites (6/11 with associated hydrothorax) and in 2 for the <br>presence of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) not responding to <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>therapy. In those with refractory ascites, four patients had HCV recurrence, <br>had de novo HBV-related cirrhosis associated with <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, 5 had veno-occlusive <br>disease and 1 had de novo Budd-Chiari syndrome. TIPS was successfully placed <br>in all patients without complications. The time between LT and TIPS <br>placement ranged from 1 to 23 months. Mean±SD MELD score before TIPS <br>placement was 17±4.7 in patients with allograft dysfunction and 13±2.4 in <br>those with vascular liver disorders (p = ns). During the follow up (31.5±33 <br>months), the latter group experienced a complete resolution of ascites and <br>normalization of liver function; on the contrary, in the 5 patients with <br>underlying liver disease only 3 had partial resolution of ascites. There <br>were three deaths out of 5 patients in the patients with underlying liver <br>disease compared to 1 death among 8 patients with vascular liver disorders. <br>Conclusions: LT recipients with portal hypertension due to allograft <br>dysfunction had a poor outcome in the absence of retransplantation and <br>portal decompression provides only marginal clinical benefit. On the <br>contrary, TIPS if indicated for the presence of vascular liver disease after <br>LT seems to be effective and provide long term-benefit.<br><br>RECORD 565<br>Portal vein obstruction after liver transplantation in children treated by <br>simultaneous minilaparotomy and transhepatic approaches: Initial experience<br>Carnevale F.C.

We <br>describe a combined technique for PV recanalization in cases of PV <br>obstruction after liver transplantation. Four children (1%), of 367 <br>subjected to liver transplantation from June 1991 to December 2008, <br>underwent PV recanalization through a combined approach (transhepatic and <br>minilaparotomy). All children received left lateral hepatic segments, <br>developed <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (n = 3) and stenosis (n = 1), and presented <br>with symptoms of portal hypertension after transplantation. PV <br>recanalization was tried by transhepatic retrograde access, and a <br>minilaparotomy was performed when percutaneous recanalization was <br>unsuccessful. Three patients underwent a successful portal recanalization <br>and stent placement with the combined technique. In one patient, the <br>recanalization was unsuccessful because of an extensive portomesenteric <br>thrombosis. The other three children had the portal flow reestablished and <br>followed with Doppler US studies. They received oral <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> for <br>three consecutive months after the procedure and the clinical symptoms <br>subsided. In case of PV obstruction, the combined approach is technically <br>feasible with good clinical and hemodynamic results.

The <br>most common manifestation of acute <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is sudden onset of abdominal pain. A <br>computed tomography scan without contrast often shows a high-density <br>material in the portal vein. After injection of contrast agents, absence of <br>luminal enhancement and enlargement of the obstructed portal vein are shown. <br>In this case report, we demonstrated a rare computed tomography finding in <br>which the diameter of the main portal vein was enormously distended to <br>3-fold that of the aorta in a patient with recent <span style="color: red">PVT</span>.

Date of Publication: <br>January 2011<br><br>Thrombotic complications in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) <br>are common and require improved awareness and prevention. In this review the <br>interface between IBD and thrombosis is discussed, with emphasis on risk <br>assessment and data to aid clinical decision making. Thromboembolic <br>complications are 3-fold more likely in IBD patients than controls and the <br>relative risk exceeds 15 during disease flares. Improved assessment of <br>thrombosis risk for an individual patient includes thorough personal and <br>family history and awareness of prothrombotic medications and lifestyle <br>choices. Patients with the highest risk of thrombosis are those with active <br>colonic disease, personal or strong family history of thrombosis, and those <br>with significant acquired risk factors. Combined risk factors or <br>hospitalization should prompt mechanical thromboprophylaxis. Indications for <br>prophylactic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> are not defined currently by clinical studies, <br>especially in pediatric patients, although some groups now advocate <br>prophylactic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> for all hospitalized IBD patients and even some <br>outpatients with disease flares. Thrombosis management requires a <br>multidisciplinary therapeutic approach to balance <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> and <br>bleeding risk. While bleeding may occur with <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in IBD, data <br>and experience indicate that therapeutic heparin is safe and bleeding <br>manifestations can be managed supportively in most patients. Until <br>prospective trials of prophylactic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> are published, management <br>of thrombotic risk and prophylaxis in IBD will remain a clinical challenge. <br>© 2010 Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America, Inc.<br><br>RECORD 570<br>Low-molecular-weight heparin successfully used to treat a nephrotic patient <br>complicated by superior mesenteric vein thrombosis and portal vein <br>thrombosis<br>Wang Y.-C.

Clinical <br>Presentation and Intervention: A 53-year-old man with nephrotic syndrome <br>developed persistent mild abdominal pain for 3 days.

Intagliata E.<br>Journal of Laparoendoscopic and Advanced Surgical Techniques (2011) 21:1 <br>(71-75). Date of Publication: 1 Jan 2011<br><br>Introduction: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) could be a life-threatening <br>complication after splenectomy if not diagnosed promptly and treated <br>properly. Risk factors of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> are not completely clarified. Spleen size and <br>underlying hematologic diseases are main potential risk factors for this <br>complication. Laparoscopic surgery might increase the risk of developing <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span>, as it reduces the blood flow in the portal system due to the <br>pneumoperitoneum but, on the other hand, it seems to be associated with less <br>postoperative modifications of coagulation parameters than open surgery, <br>thus preventing <span style="color: red">PVT</span> itself. The authors reviewed their series on open and <br>laparoscopic splenectomies, pointing out their experience on <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and <br>discussing their surveillance and prophylaxis programs to prevent this <br>complication. Materials and Methods: In this series, the authors report <br>their experience on postsplenectomy <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in 162 patients who have been <br>splenectomised (102 operated on laparoscopically and 60 by open surgery). <br>Results: <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was clinically observed in 1 case out of 60 open splenectomies <br>and in 3 cases out of 102 laparoscopic procedures. Patients were treated <br>with conservative <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy. In one case, additional ileal <br>resection was needed. Mortality was 0%.

Methods: Our cohort includes 13 <br>consecutive patients. Eleven were considered for Transjugular intrahepatic <br>portosystemic shunt placement for complications not manageable by <br>medical/endoscopic treatment and two because of the need of oral <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in presence of high-risk varices. <br>Expanded-polytetrafluoroethylene-covered stents were used in all. Results: <br>One of the 13 patients was excluded because of a thrombosis of the superior <br>cava and jugular veins. In 10 patients, Transjugular intrahepatic <br>portosystemic shunt was successfully implanted [83.3%; 95% confidence <br>interval: 52-98%]. One patient had an early shunt dysfunction with <br>recurrence of variceal bleeding which required an emergency surgical shunt. <br>Late shunt dysfunction occurred in two patients, successfully treated with <br>angioplasty and re-stenting. Two patients experienced an episode of <br>encephalopathy. Conclusions: Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt <br>is feasible in most of the patients with portal cavernoma and should be <br>considered in those with severe complications uncontrolled by conventional <br>therapy. The use of Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt to achieve <br>a lifelong <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy in selected patients with high-risk <br>varices may be another possible indication.

Date <br>of Publication: December 2010<br><br>Pylephlebitis is a condition with significant morbidity and mortality. We <br>review herein 100 relevant case reports published since 1971. Eighty-one <br>patients were reported with acute pylephlebitis, while the remaining <br>patients had chronic pylephlebitis. The most common predisposing infections <br>leading to pylephlebitis were diverticulitis and appendicitis. Cultures from <br>blood or other tissues were positive in 77%. The infection was polymicrobial <br>in half of the patients and the most common isolates were Bacteroides spp, <br>Escherichia coli and Streptococcus spp. Thrombosis was extended to the <br>superior mesenteric vein (SMV), splenic vein, and intrahepatic branches of <br>the portal vein (PV) in 42%, 12%, and 39%, respectively. Antibiotics were <br>administered in all and <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in 35 cases. Patients who received <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> had a favourable outcome compared to those who received <br>antibiotics alone (complete recanalization 25.7% vs 14.8% (p > 0.05), no <br>recanalization 5.7% vs 22.2% (p < 0.05), and death 5.7% vs 22.2% (p < <br>0.01)). Cases with complete recanalization had prompt diagnosis and <br>management and two-thirds were recently published.

Date of Publication: December <br>2010<br><br>Introduction: Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-associated thrombosis has been reported <br>sporadically in the medical literature until now. However, thrombosis <br>incidence and its risk factors have never been studied in a cohort of <br>patients with acute CMV infection. Materials and Methods: A retrospective <br>case-control study. Medical charts and imaging study reports of all <br>consecutive patients diagnosed with acute CMV infection during the years <br>2005-2006 in a tertiary medical center were reviewed for the presence of <br>arterial and/or venous thromboses, and their acquired as well as inherited <br>predispositions. The control group included age-matched and sex-matched <br>consecutive patients, in whom acute CMV infection was excluded. Laboratory <br>tests used for acute CMV infection diagnosis/exclusion were also matched, <br>including serology, antigenemia, and PCR. Results: Included were 140 <br>patients with acute CMV infection (study group) and 140 consecutive matched <br>patients in whom acute CMV infection was excluded (control group). Among the <br>control group, none of the patients had thrombosis, while among the study <br>group, nine (6.4%; p = 0.003) patients had thrombosis: five (3.6%; p = <br>0.025) patients had arterial thrombosis and four (2.9%; p = 0.045) patients <br>had venous thrombosis. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that acute <br>CMV infection was independently associated with thrombosis among the whole <br>cohort (p = 0.004), while use of oral contraceptives/hormones or pregnancy <br>were independently associated with thrombosis among patients with acute CMV <br>infection (p = 0.043). Conclusions: Thrombosis in patients with acute CMV <br>infection is not rare. Acute CMV infection is associated with thrombosis <br>independent of other risk factors for thrombosis. We hope to raise <br>physician's awareness to the association between acute CMV infection and <br>thrombosis. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Kim D.-I.<br>Chirurgia (2010) 23:6 (235-240). Date of Publication: December 2010<br><br>Aim. Acute mesenteric vein thrombosis (MVT) and <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) <br>are associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality due in part to the <br>difficulty to diagnostic them and the operative challenges. The initial <br>treatment for MVT and <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is controversial. Some authors have proposed a <br>surgical approach, whereas others have advocated medical therapy <br>(<span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>). In this study, we analyzed and compared the results <br>obtained with surgical and medical treatments to determine the best initial <br>management for this disease. Methods. We retrospectively reviewed the <br>hospital records and clinical data of 10 patients who were treated for MVT <br>and <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Each patient was assessed for the diagnosis, initial management <br>(laparotomy or <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>), the morbidity and mortality and the <br>duration of hospitalization. Results. All of the patients were initially <br>treated with unfractionated heparin. The mean hospital stay was 20 days. One <br>patient underwent emergency laparotomy with bowel resection, while two <br>patients developed stricture during the follow-up period that necessitated <br>resection and anastomosis of the bowel. The other seven patients underwent <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy only. During the follow-up period, all the patients <br>were checked by computed tomography (CT). Five patients showed improvement, <br>four patients showed no change and one patient showed worsened MVT and <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. <br>Nine patients showed cavernous transformation of the venous system along the <br>mesenteric vein and portal vein on CT. There was no mortality. Conclusion. <br>Nonoperative management for acute MVT and <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is feasible when the bowel <br>infarction has not led to transmural necrosis and bowel perforation. The <br>morbidity, mortality and long-term outcomes were similar for the cases of <br>surgical and nonoperative management. A nonoperative approach, when <br>indicated, avoids resection of the macroscopically infarcted small bowel in <br>cases that are potentially reversible with <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> alone.<br><br>RECORD 578<br>Thromboembolic and bleeding complications in acute leukemia<br>Kwaan H.C.

Martinelli I.<br>Internal and Emergency Medicine (2010) 5:6 (487-494). Date of Publication: <br>December 2010<br><br>The term splanchnic vein thrombosis encompasses Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS), <br>extrahepatic portal vein obstruction (EHPVO), and mesenteric vein <br>thrombosis; the simultaneous involvement of additional regions is frequent, <br>and clinical presentations and risk factors may be shared. The annual <br>incidence of BCS and isolated mesenteric vein thrombosis is less than one <br>per million individuals, while the incidence of EHPVO is about four per <br>million; autopsy studies, however, suggest higher numbers. Current advances <br>in non-invasive vascular imaging allow for the identification of chronic or <br>asymptomatic forms. Risk factors can be local or systemic. A local <br>precipitating factor is rare in BCS, while it is common in patients with <br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. Chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are the <br>leading systemic cause of splanchnic vein thrombosis, and are diagnosed in <br>half the BCS patients and one-third of the EHPVO patients. The molecular <br>marker JAK2 V617F is detectable in a large majority of patients with overt <br>MPN, and up to 40% of patients without overt MPN. Inherited thrombophilia is <br>present in at least one-third of the patients, and the factor V Leiden or <br>the prothrombin G20210A mutations are the most common mutations found in BCS <br>or EHPVO patients, respectively. Multiple factors are present in <br>approximately one-third of the patients with BCS and two-thirds of the <br>patients with <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. Immediate <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> with heparin <br>is used to treat patients acutely. Upon clinical deterioration, <br>catheter-directed thrombolysis or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic <br>shunt is used in conjunction with <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. Long-term oral <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> with vitamin K-antagonists (VKA) is recommended in all BCS <br>patients, and in the patients with a permanent prothrombotic state <br>associated with an unprovoked EHPVO. In patients with an unprovoked EHPVO <br>and no prothrombotic conditions, or in those with a provoked EHPVO, <br>anticoagulant treatment is recommended for a minimum of 3-6 months. © SIMI <br>2010.<br><br>RECORD 580<br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> after splenectomy for hypersplenism in patients with <br><span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span>: An analysis of 22 cases<br>Meng J.

The severe <br>clinical complication in patients with acute <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> is <br>ischemic intestinal infarction when the thrombus extends to the mesenteric <br>venous arch. The complications include bleeding due to gastroesophageal <br>varices, ascites and deterioration of live function in the patients with <br>chronic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. The recently-published Practice Guidelines <br>indicate that the treatment of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> includes <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, thrombolysis, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt <br>(TIPS) and surgical thrombectomy. TIPS has some advantages in treating <br>portal vein thrombus. It can directly and effectively re-canalize the <br>occluded portal vein.

The disadvantages <br>of TIPS include technical difficulties and potential complications. However, <br>percutaneous transhepatic, transsplenic and transmesenteric approaches well <br>facilitate the TIPS procedure.

Though there are small case series suggesting that <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> improves portal vein patency before liver transplantation <br>(LT), there is little data to compare the post-transplantation outcomes <br>between cirrhosis with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> who are not anticoagulated and cirrhotics with no <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Aims: To: (1) define the technical challenges for OLT posed by partial <br>or complete <span style="color: red">PVT</span>; (2) measure the impact of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> on 60- and 180-day mortality; <br>(3) estimate the value of pre-operative <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> on OLT outcome. <br>Methods: A prospectively followed cohort of cirrhotics evaluated for LT at a <br>large tertiary care academic medical center between 2006 and 2008 with a <br>minimum 6 month follow up after evaluation were included.

Results: Among 932 cirrhotics evaluated for transplant, all 294 <br>with follow up of at least 6 months were included. Seventy patients were <br>diagnosed to have <span style="color: red">PVT</span> after evaluation prior to LT (group 1) and 224 <br>developed no <span style="color: red">PVT</span> (group2). There was no difference in age, etiology of liver <br>disease and MELD scores between the groups. Forty-five percent had occlusive <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Forty-two (60%) and 150 (64%) in the two groups underwent OLT.

Of the 42 with <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span> who underwent OLT, 25 (60%) required thombectomy at the time of <br>transplantation and 10 (25%) resolved thrombosis in the absence of <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. There was no difference in the 60- or 180-day post <br>transplant mortality between patients with and without <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Conclusion: <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>did not increase rate 60- or 180- day post transplant mortality.

Pregnancies occurred 6 months <br>or more after <span style="color: red">PVT</span> diagnosis. Results: 23 women, median age 32 years (20-45) <br>had 42 pregnancies (France n=16, Netherlands n=13, Spain n=13). Median <br>duration between <span style="color: red">PVT</span> diagnosis and pregnancy was 54 months (7 to 370 <br>months). Twenty-one women had portal vein obstruction, including 8 with <br>mesenteric vein (MV) obstruction; 2 left or right portal vein obstruction, <br>including 1 with MV obstruction. Fifteen had oesophageal varices, which had <br>ruptured in 9.Four had myeloproliferative disorder, 7protein S or C <br>deficiency, 3 antiphospholipid syndrome, 1 factor V Leiden and 1 <br>prothrombine gene mutation. Low molecular weight heparin (LWMH) was started <br>before gestation-week 5 in 14 pregnancies; and after week 6 in 13. No LMWH <br>was given during 15 pregnancies. Median duration of gestation was 36 weeks <br>(range 6-39 weeks). Eight fetuses were lost before week 20. There were 2 <br>very preterm birth at week 24-25; 19 moderately preterm birth (at 32-36 <br>weeks); and 13 term birth (after week 37). One infant underwent emergency <br>surgery for a cardiac malformation; another infant had hyaline membrane <br>disease, and necrotic colitis, both with favourable outcome. Two mothers had <br>HELLP syndrome at week 24 and 33 respectively. There were 3/17 parietal <br>bleeding after caesarean sections, and 1/17 genital bleeding after vaginal <br>deliveries. Two oesophageal variceal bleedings occurred, in the absence of <br>primary prophylaxis, at week 18 and 38 respectively. Three had ascites <br>during pregnancy. Post-partum splenic infarction occurred once without <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. In univariate analysis, significant prognosis factors for <br>unfavourable outcome of pregnancy were high platelets (253 +/- 140 vs <br>220+/-78 (p=0.017), past history of spontaneous abortion or deep vein <br>thrombosis (p=0,042) and past oestrogen contraception (p=0,008). There were <br>no deaths. Conclusions: In chronic <span style="color: red">PVT</span> patients, who become pregnant, foetal <br>outcome is generally favourable and maternal outcome is good. Variceal <br>bleeding is rare. HELLP syndrome seems more common than expected. Thrombotic <br>events can occur postpartum in the absence of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. Therefore, <br>intensified prophylaxis for portal hypertension, close surveillance for <br>HELLP, and brief <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> interruption around delivery may reduce the <br>rate of bleeding and thrombotic complications in these patients.<br><br>RECORD 585<br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> associated with primary cytomegalovirus infection in <br>an immunocompetent child<br>Alkhouri N.

Serologic tests were negative for hepatitis A, <br>hepatitis B, hepatitis C, Epstein-Barr virus, HIV infection and antibodies <br>to toxoplasmosis. Antibodies were detected against CMV with both positive <br>IgG and IgM; CMV DNA was detected by PCR. Screening for thrombophilia <br>revealed normal levels of protein C, protein S, antithrombin III and <br>homocysteine with no prothrombin or factor V Leiden mutations and no <br>antiphospholipid antibodies. A diagnosis of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> secondary <br>to acute CMV infection was made. The patient was started on heparin and <br>transitioned to oral anticoagulant therapy. Repeated ultrasound in 3 months <br>showed recanalization of the portal vein and improved splenomegaly. This <br>case illustrates that in the presence of acute CMV infection with abdominal <br>pain, the possibility of abdominal venous thrombosis should be always <br>entertained in order to start <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> as soon as possible. Acute CMV <br>hepatitis should be added to the list of risk factors of acute portal vein <br>thrombosis.<br><br>RECORD 586<br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in cirrhotic patients is associated with advanced <br>liver disease and predicts poor long term prognosis<br>Ferreira C.N. Rodrigues T. Alexandrino P. Ramalho F. Velosa J.F.<br>Hepatology (2010) 52 SUPPL. 1 (1072A). Date of Publication: October 2010<br><br>Introduction Though the prevalence non-hepatocelular carcinoma( HCC) <br>associated <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) in cirrhotic patients ranges between <br>0.6 - 16%, the influence on prognosis is not clear. Aims: To characterize <br>non-HCC associated <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in cirrhosis and determine it's influence on <br>prognosis. Methods We studied 40 consecutive cirrhotic patients with non-HCC <br>associated <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Patient characteristics: Age 57±14years; Males 65%(26); <br>Child-Pugh (CP) score 8±3, Model for End-Stage Liver Disase (MELD) score <br>15±7; CP class: A-25%(10), B-50%(20), C-25%(10); Aetiology of cirrhosis: <br>alcohol-60%(20), viral-12.5%(5), alcohol+viral-10%(4), others-11.5%(7). The <br>effect of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> on short (1 year) and long term (3 years) mortality was <br>analyzed by comparing with a control group of 135 patients with <br>decompensated cirrhosis matched for CP and MELD scores, age and aetiology of <br><span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span>. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 18. Results At <br>diagnosis of <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, 88%(35)patients were symptomatic. Clinical features: upper <br>gastrointestinal bleeding-55%(22), abdominal pain-33%(13), <br>nausea/vomiting-13%(5), intestinal infarction- 5%(2) and diarrhoea-5%(2). <br>Manifestations of portal hypertension: oesophageal varices-88%(35), severe <br>portal hypertensive gastropathy-65%(26), gastric varices-40% (16), ectopic <br>varices-13%(5) and ascites-65%(26). At diagnosis, acute <span style="color: red">PVT</span> of the main <br>trunk and/or main branches occurred in 90%(36) and portal cavernoma in <br>10%(4). There was concomitant superior mesenteric vein thrombosis in 25%(10) <br>and splenic vein thrombosis in 20%(8). Median follow up was 6.5months(IQR <br>3.5). Survival at the end of follow-up was 58%(23). Compared to control <br>group, <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was significantly associated with higher mortality at 3 years but <br>not at 1 year (p=0.001). The association of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> with higher mortality was <br>observed in patients with CP score <10 but not in those with CP score ≥10. <br>By unconditional multivariate logistic regression analysis, cirrhotic <br>patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> had significantly higher mortality at 3 years (Odds Ratio <br>6, 95% Confidence Interval 2-18). Actuarial survival analysis showed that <br>when compared to control group, mortality in patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> tends to <br>increase significantly six months after diagnosis (p=0.037). Kaplan- Meier <br>survival analysis confirmed the poor long term prognosis in patients with <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span> (p=0.034). Conclusions <span style="color: red">PVT</span> occurs predominantly in advanced liver <br>cirrhosis and is associated with poor long term prognosis. The effect of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>on higher mortality was only observed in Child-Pugh A and B patients. Our <br>results suggest that aggressive management of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> with <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> when <br>possible, could improve long term prognosis.<br><br>RECORD 587<br>The impact of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) on cirrhotics awaiting liver <br>transplantation<br>John B.V. Konjeti V.R. Aggarwal A. Lopez R. Zein N.N. Atreja A. Carey W.D.<br>Hepatology (2010) 52 SUPPL. 1 (888A-889A). Date of Publication: October 2010<br><br>Background: Most cirrhotic portal vein thromboses (c<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) are discovered <br>incidentally and not treated with anti-coagulation. According to 2009 AASLD <br>guidelines, there is little information on the impact of portal vein <br>thrombosis on morbidity and mortality of cirrhosis or the value of <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. Aims: To: 1. Estimate incidence and prevalence of c<span style="color: red">PVT</span> in <br>subjects evaluated for liver transplantation (LT). 2. Identify risk factors <br>of developing new c<span style="color: red">PVT</span>. 3. Describe the effect of c<span style="color: red">PVT</span> on natural history. <br>4. Compare mortality on OLT list between those with and without c<span style="color: red">PVT</span>. <br>Methods: Data was collected from a prospectively followed cohort of <br>cirrhotics evaluated for LT at large tertiary care academic medical center <br>between 2006 and 2008. All patients were evaluated with a liver vascular <br>ultrasound and contrast CT or MRI at initial LT evaluation and every 6 <br>months while they were on the transplant list. Patients with hepatocellular <br>carcinoma at diagnosis of c<span style="color: red">PVT</span> were excluded. Results: Among 932 cirrhotics <br>evaluated for OLT, all 294 with follow up of over 6 months were included. <br>Forty-eight had c<span style="color: red">PVT</span> at baseline (group 1), 22 developed new c<span style="color: red">PVT</span> (group 2) <br>and 224 developed no c<span style="color: red">PVT</span> (group 3). The incidence of new c<span style="color: red">PVT</span> was 8.7 per <br>100 person-years of follow up, with cumulative incidence of 7.8% and 16.8% <br>at 12 and 24 months. There was no difference in age, etiology of cirrhosis <br>and MELD between the groups. Forty-five percent had occlusive c<span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Only 3 <br>of 70 with c<span style="color: red">PVT</span> (group 1 and 2), and 3 of 224 cirrhotics without c<span style="color: red">PVT</span> (2 <br>calf venous thrombosis, 1 cardiac) were anti-coagulated. On multivariate <br>analysis, ascites and worsening renal function predicted new onset c<span style="color: red">PVT</span>; <br>prior endoscopic treatment for varices did not increase risk. Subjects who <br>developed new c<span style="color: red">PVT</span> had greater worsening of Child score. In group 1, 2 and <br>3, respectively, GI bleeding occurred in 18.8%, 18.2% and 11.7%, (p=0.3) and <br>spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in 2.1%, 4.6% and 12.1% (p=0.06). <br>Twelve (25%), 5(22%) and 42 (19%) in groups 1,2 and 3 respectively died <br>before LT. Factors affecting mortality include MELD, ascites and baseline <br>alpha-fetoprotein. There was no difference in mortality while awaiting LT <br>between subjects with and without c<span style="color: red">PVT</span> on univariable or multivariable <br>analysis. (p=0.16) Conclusion: The incidence of c<span style="color: red">PVT</span> in those evaluated for <br>LT is 8.7/100 person years. Ascites at baseline and worse renal function are <br>risk factors for developing new c<span style="color: red">PVT</span>. c<span style="color: red">PVT</span> did not increase GI bleeding, SBP <br>or mortality on the transplant list. Our data does not support a role for <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in patients with c<span style="color: red">PVT</span>.<br><br>RECORD 588<br>Surgical intervention for patent ductus venosus<br>Kamimatsuse A. Onitake Y. Kamei N. Tajima G. Sakura N. Sueda T. Hiyama E.<br>Pediatric Surgery International (2010) 26:10 (1025-1030). Date of <br>Publication: October 2010<br><br>Patent ductus venosus (PDV) is a rare condition, which usually presents <br>secondary to hepatic atrophy and hepatic failure. We have treated eight <br>cases of PDV, all with hypergalactosemia and hyperbilirubinemia. <br>Ultrasonography and three-dimensional computed tomography demonstrated <br>communication between the portal vein and the inferior vena cava. Of the <br>eight PDV cases, three from the older age group (ages 9, 11, and 14 years) <br>had high-density lesions in their brain nucleus, and one case (age 19 years) <br>had undergone prior Kasai portoenterostomy for biliary atresia. Six PDV <br>patients underwent ligation of PDV and the remaining two cases underwent <br>partial banding of PDV with intraoperative monitoring to maintain portal <br>vein pressure (PVP) under 30 cm H(2)O. Improvement of the intrahepatic <br>portal vein flow was achieved by ligation or banding of PDV. <br>Postoperatively, serum galactose and bilirubin fell to normal ranges, but <br>portal thrombus occurred postoperatively in the first case. We subsequently <br>administered postoperative <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in the remaining cases and <br>experienced no major complications. These results suggest that PDV ligation <br>and banding are effective surgical approaches for patients with PDV. Close <br>postoperative monitoring to avoid portal thrombus is imperative in these <br>cases. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.<br><br>RECORD 589<br>Portal biliopathy: An unusual cause of asymptomatic biliary ductal dilation<br>Lakshminarayan S.T.K. Demetria M. Attar B.<br>American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010) 105 SUPPL. 1 (S208-S209). Date <br>of Publication: October 2010<br><br>Purpose: Portal biliopathy, a late complication of portal hypertension <br>refers to abnormalities of the entire biliary tract. A 48-year-old female <br>with 2-weeks of intermittent epigastric pain unrelated to food or bowel <br>movements, unremarkable physical exam and laboratory work up showed a portal <br>vein thrombus with cavernous transformation on CT abdomen. Intra- and <br>extrahepatic biliary dilation due to extrinsic compression by the portal <br>cavernoma was seen and confirmed by MRI/MRCP. No biliary stones or <br>strictures were seen. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was initiated for the portal vein <br>thrombosis. No intervention for biliary ductal dilation was planned, given <br>the absence of biliary symptoms or abnormal liver function tests. Portal <br>biliopathy is more common with extrahepatic portal vein obstruction <br>(81-100%) than cirrhosis (0-33%). Etiology is thought to be external <br>pressure from biliary collaterals and/or ischemia. Only 20% are symptomatic <br>from cholestasis or cholangitis. MRCP and MR portovenography is the initial <br>investigation of choice, and may show extrahepatic strictures, intrahepatic <br>biliary radicle, ectasias and filling defects. EUS may be useful in cases of <br>diagnostic uncertainty. Asymptomatic patients require no treatment. If <br>symptomatic, treatment options are endoscopy (sphincterotomy, stone <br>extraction, stricture dilation, stenting) or surgery (portosystemic <br>shunting, bilioenteric anastomosis). Surgery provides long-term relief and <br>is preferable in young patients with a shuntable vein. Portosystemic <br>shunting is a safer and more effective than bilioenteric anastomosis. <br>Hemobilia may occur with balloon sweeps and sphincterotomy due to the <br>presence of varicosities around the ampulla and CBD, and with basket <br>extraction due to intraluminal choledochal varices mimicking stones. TIPSS <br>is a therapeutic option. Liver transplant can be life saving in certain <br>cases. In conclusion, portal biliopathy is a rare cause of extrinsic biliary <br>compression that may rarely cause cholestasis, choledocholithiasis or <br>cholangitis. Surgical portosystemic shunting is the treatment of choice in <br>the presence of symptoms.

Sartori M.T. Rossetto V. Cillo U. Rodriguez K.I. Nadal E. Zanus <br>G. Burroughs A.K. Burra P.<br>Hepatology (2010) 52 SUPPL. 1 (903A). Date of Publication: October 2010<br><br>Background: There is no established management algorithm for the treatment <br>of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in patients with cirrhosis. The aim of our study was to prospectively <br>evaluate the use of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> and TIPS, as a second line option, to <br>treat <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Methods: patients with cirrhosis and with non malignant <span style="color: red">PVT</span> were <br>included. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> with LWMH was considered in all; TIPS was <br>indicated if there was a concomitant of portal hypertensive complication, or <br>if thrombosis progressed. Patients seen in the same period, but who were not <br>anticoagulated neither received TIPS, were included as controls. Results: 56 <br>patients were included (21 were controls). In the study group, <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was <br>occlusive in 11/35 with extension to the superior mesenteric vein or splenic <br>vein in 13/35. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was initiated in 33 patients. Mean <br>follow-up±SD was 21.6±8.5 and 24.5±8.2 months for study and control groups <br>respectively. Complete recanalization rate was 36% (12/33) in the treatment <br>group compared to 1 among controls (p<0.001). A short time interval between <br>appearance of thrombosis and <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> (< 6 months) strongly predicted <br>chance of repermeation. During the follow-up there was progression of <br>thrombosis in 15/21 who were not anticoagulated and in 5/33 anticoagulated <br>patients (p<0.001). TIPS was placed in 6 patients. There were 5 patients <br>with variceal bleeding and 2 intestinal venous infarcts in the control <br>group, compared to 1 variceal bleeding episode in the study group. <br>Conclusions: a treatment algorithm with <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> and the use of TIPS <br>in patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and cirrhosis achieves a good chance of complete <br>repermeation, reduces portal hypertensive complications and decreases the <br>rate of thrombosis progression. This should lead to improved survival and <br>renders liver transplantation less difficult.

Little information are available on its <br>natural history, clinical outcome and prognostic factors. Aim. To describe <br>our single-centre experience on non-cirrhotic non-neoplastic patients with <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Patients. Fifty-five consecutive patients (31 male/24 female; <br>age:46.7±15.1 yrs; 10 acute and 45 chronic <span style="color: red">PVT</span>) were enrolled from January <br>1999 to December 2009 and followed-up for 30.7±37.9 months by the same <br>medical team according to a prospective, protocolized, diagnostic work-up <br>and surveillance strategy. Therapeutic protocol included the use of <br>long-term <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> when possible and the treatment of varices at risk <br>with drugs, endoscopy or TIPS. Results. At entry, a portal cavernoma was <br>found in 45 patients. A multisegmental thrombosis was present in 25 patients <br>(splenic vein in 18, superior mesenteric vein in 19, Budd-Chiari syndrome in <br>5). Chronic myeloproliferative disorders were found in 16 patients, one or <br>more prothrombotic coagulation disorders in 27 and PNH in 2. At entry, 17 <br>patients had a past episode of variceal bleeding (in 13 as the initial <br>manifestation); 17 had no or small varices and 11 large varices. Eleven out <br>of 17 patients with no or small varices at entry developed large varices <br>during follow-up. The rate of progression was 11% (95%CI:4-31%) at one year <br>and 28% (95%CI:16-51%) at two years. By multivariate analysis, small varices <br>at first endoscopy and a multisegmental involvement at entry were <br>independent predictors for the variceal progression. During follow-up, 6 <br>patients bled and 5 rebled from varices. The cumulative bleeding rate were: <br>13% (95%CI:6-28%) at one year and 20% (95%CI:11-36%) at two years. The <br>finding of a multisegmental thrombosis at entry was the only independent <br>predictor for variceal bleeding. Ten patients experienced new thrombotic <br>episodes during follow-up (5 in splanchnic and 5 in extra-splanchnic <br>vessels). The cumulative rate of new thrombotic events was 11% at one year <br>(95%CI:5-25%) and 16% (95%CI:8-31%) at two years. The presence of a <br>multisegmental thrombosis at entry was the only independent factor for the <br>occurrence of new thrombotic events. Of the 10 patients with acute <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, 7 <br>achieved a complete ricanalization while 3 developed a portal cavernoma. <br>Five patients died during follow-up. There were no bleeding-related deaths, <br>while two patients died because of thrombotic events. Two-year cumulative <br>survival was 95% (95%CI:84-98%). Conclusions: A multisegment involvement of <br>the portal system at entry seems to be an important prognostic factor for <br>the clinical outcome of non-cirrhotic patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span>.<br><br>RECORD 592<br>Endoscopic evaluation and management of autoimmune pancreatitis complicated <br>with pancreatic ascites: A case report<br>Martinez-Vazquez M.A. Garza-Galindo A.A. Vazquez-Elizondo G. Maldonado-Garza <br>H.J.<br>American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010) 105 SUPPL. 1 (S212). Date of <br>Publication: October 2010<br><br>Purpose: Autoimmune Pancreatitis (AIP) is a unique disease characterized by <br>pancreatic inflammation and elevated serum IgG4 levels. Although the disease <br>usually presents as a form of chronic pancreatitis, acute manifestations <br>during a first episode or exacerbations are not uncommon. We describe the <br>approach and management of a patient presenting with acute pancreatitis (AP) <br>who developed multiple complications. Case report: An 18-year-old male with <br>a 5-year history of recurrent pancreatitis and no other known diseases was <br>hospitalized with severe abdominal pain, weight loss, ascites and left lower <br>extremity deep vein thrombosis. Bloodwork upon admission included <br>significant hipoalbuminemia (2.2 mg/dl) and a serum IgG4 markedly elevated <br>at 533 mg/dL, with high total IgG levels at 2,012 mg/dL. Ascitic fluid <br>analysis reported an amylase at 27,500 UI. Abdominal ultrasound showed <br>evidence of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>, ascities and acute pancreatitis. <br>Computed tomography imaging demonstrated a dilated main pancreatic duct (PD) <br>and a pancreatic head cystic lesion. Endoscopic ultrasound showed <br>alterations compatible with severe acute pancreatitis complicated with fluid <br>collections and ascites. An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography <br>(ERCP) was performed, detecting rupture of the PD a pancreatic stent was <br>placed. after marked improvement of ascites on the following 7 days, the <br>patient was discharged and placed on oral <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. On outpatient <br>follow-up, patient's ascites gradually resolved, his nutritional status <br>improved and the pancreatic stent was removed after 8 weeks, documenting <br>resolution of the PD rupture and a focal pancreatic duct stenosis at this <br>level on ERCP, which was treated with balloon dilatation to 12 Fr. A <br>prednisone regimen tapered to a maintenance dose of 5 to 10 mg/day was <br>continued until clinical and laboratory evaluation fully resolved (length of <br>follow-up). Discussion: Severe acute AIP with pancreatic duct disruption is <br>uncommon and, as occurs with most pancreatitis, the approach for this <br>complication is usually challenging. As reported in this case, conventional <br>management with pancreatic stent placement and treatment of the primary <br>etiology with close patient follow-up to determine the time of stent removal <br>and further endoscopic treatment during ERCP as needed is recommended. <br>Conclusion: Transpapillary pancreatic stent placement can be useful in the <br>management of pancreatic ascites due to AIP and reduce the length of <br>hospitalization and the need for more aggressive interventions in these <br>patients.<br><br>RECORD 593<br>Left ventricular thrombus in a patient with active crohn's disease: A case <br>report<br>Springston C. Greenspan A.<br>American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010) 105 SUPPL. 1 (S349). Date of <br>Publication: October 2010<br><br>Purpose: Inflammatory bowel disease increases the risk of thromboembolism, <br>especially during acute exacerbations. Several case-based and larger studies <br>have previously reported cerebral, pulmonary, caval and portal vein thrombus <br>formation. To date, the prevalence of IBD-associated cardiac <br>intraventricular thrombus formation is not well established. A 42 year old, <br>Caucasian female with a two year history of Crohn's disease complicated by <br>recurrent flares necessitating oral corticosteroid therapy presented with <br>abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, fever and oral mucosal ulcers. A two week <br>course of prednisone, ciprofloxacin and metronidazole did not improve her <br>symptoms. Complete blood count revealed a hematocrit of 22% and Computerized <br>Tomography showed mild colitis distal to the mid transverse colon down to <br>her anus. An incidental finding of a left ventricular mass was also <br>reported. Magnetic Resonance Imaging and 2D Echocardiography showed a smooth <br>edged mass arising from the left ventricular apex consistent with a <br>thrombus. Left ventricular ejection fraction was well preserved despite mild <br>hypokinesis of the thin-walled, left ventricular apex. The patient did not <br>exhibit signs and symptoms consistent with cardioembolic diseases. <br>Hypercoagulability studies were unremarkable (factor V Leiden, Antithrombin <br>III, protein C, protein S). The patient had no prior personal or family <br>history of thrombus formation. Systemic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> with warfarin was <br>initiated. Following adequate control of her Crohn's disease with infliximab <br>and prednisone, the patient underwent surgical removal of the left <br>ventricular mass via thoracotomy, which was confirmed as a thrombus by gross <br>and microscopic evaluation. We report an extremely rare case of cardiac <br>thrombus complicating refractory Crohn's disease. This rare extraintestinal <br>manifestation of Crohn's disease can lead to significant morbidity including <br>cerebrovascular accident and possibly death.

Hoekstra J. Hansen B.E. Janssen H.L.<br>Hepatology (2010) 52 SUPPL. 1 (1068A). Date of Publication: October 2010<br><br>Background: In patients with non cirrhotic extrahepatic portal vein <br>thrombosis (E<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy should be considered if a recent <br>thrombosis or prothrombotic state is present. However, data on this topic <br>are scarce. Aim of this study was to assess the effect of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>therapy on recanalization, risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and recurrent <br>thrombotic events in patient with E<span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Methods: Consecutive patients with <br>non cirrhotic E<span style="color: red">PVT</span>, seen at our hospital from 1985 to 2009 were enrolled. <br>Data were collected by systematic chart review. Results: Hundred-twenty <br>patients (36% male;median age 44 years (range16-87))were included (median <br>follow up 5.5 years(range 0.1-32.5)). Forty patients had acute E<span style="color: red">PVT</span> and 71 <br>patients had chronic E<span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Sixty-six patients were treated with <br>anticoagulants. Recanalization was seen in 9(23%) patients with a recent <br>thrombosis, six of whom used anticoagulants. Anticoagulants had a positive <br>effect on recanalization (HR 2.6 p=0.14). Acute thrombosis (HR13.3 p=0.02) <br>and presence of IBD (HR6.6 p=0.005) were significant predictors of <br>recanalization. Failure of recanalization was significantly associated with <br>presence of ascites (HR3.0 p=<0.01). In 37 patients 83 bleeding events <br>occurred (variceal bleeding n= 52 and gastrointestinal non variceal bleeding <br>n=31). Bleeding risk was 33% at 1-, 43% at 5- and 46% at 10- years. <br>Gastrointestinal bleeding at diagnosis (HR2.1 p=0.007), ascites (HR2.0 <br>p=0.01) and use of anticoagulants (HR2.0 p=0.008) were significant <br>predictors of (re)bleeding. Anticoagulants had no effect on the severity of <br>gastrointestinal bleeding. Four fatal gastrointestinal bleedings occurred, <br>two of whom used anticoagulants. Twenty-two new thrombotic events occurred <br>in 19 patients (venous n=15 arterial n=7). Thrombotic risk was 3 % at 1- 8% <br>at 5- and 24% at 10- years. Seventy-four percent of the thrombotic events <br>occurred in patients with a prothrombotic disorder. Anticoagulants <br>diminished the risk of venous thrombosis (HR 0.2 p= 0.11). Presence of a <br>prothrombotic disorder (HR 3.1 p= 0.03) was the only significant predictor <br>of a new thrombotic event. Bleeding or <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy had no <br>significant effect on survival. Conclusion In patients with E<span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>recanalization is significantly associated with acute thrombosis, and the <br>presence of IBD.

Date <br>of Publication: September 2010<br><br>Purpose: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> is a complication that occurs anytime after <br>liver transplantation and can compromise the patient and graft survival. We <br>describe a combined technique for portal vein recanalization in cases of <br>portal vein obstruction after liver transplantation. Materials and Methods: <br>Four children (1%), of 367 subjected to liver transplantation from June 1991 <br>to December 2008, underwent portal vein recanalization through a combined <br>approach (transhepatic and minilaparotomy). Results: All children received <br>left lateral hepatic segments, developed <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (n=3) and <br>stenosis (n=1), and presented with symptoms of portal hypertension after <br>transplantation. Portal vein recanalization was tried by transhepatic <br>retrograde access, and a minilaparotomy was performed when percutaneous <br>recanalization was unsuccessful. Three patients underwent a successful <br>portal recanalization and stent placement with the combined technique. In <br>one patient, the recanalization was unsuccessful because of an extensive <br>portomesenteric thrombosis. The other three children had the portal flow <br>reestablished and followed with Doppler ultrasound studies. They received <br>oral <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> for 3 consecutive months after the procedure and the <br>clinical symptoms subsided. Conclusion: In case of portal vein obstruction, <br>the combined approach is technically feasible with good clinical and <br>hemodynamic results. It is a minimally invasive procedure and can be tried <br>to avoid or delay surgical treatment or retransplantation.<br><br>RECORD 599<br>TIPS - Where are we now?<br>Bilbao J.I.<br>CardioVascular and Interventional Radiology (2010) 33 SUPPL. 2 (140-141). <br>Date of Publication: September 2010<br><br>The idea of percutaneously establishing an intrahepatic connection between <br>the hepatic veins and the portal vein dates back to 1969 when Rösch and <br>Hanafee described the technique in laboratory animals (1). The intrahepatic <br>tract between the portal vein and the hepatic vein was created using Teflon <br>dilators and the connection was kept patent with a plastic tube. The <br>introduction of the angioplasty balloon catheter allowed performing the <br>dilatation in a less traumatic fashion. In 1983 Colapinto presented a group <br>of patients in whom the procedure had been carried out with balloons without <br>inserting any devices for stabilising the venous connection. As expected, <br>the patency rate was poor (2). The experimental studies carried out by <br>Palmaz, with the prosthesis designed by him (3), finally allowed to perform <br>a transjugular intrahepatic porto systemic shunt (TIPS) in a safe and <br>efficient manner. The first human cases were presented by Richter in 1989 <br>(4) and since, many articles with variable numbers of patients, randomized <br>clinical trials and clinical notes have been published. This body of work <br>allows for the establishment of clinical recommendations on when and in <br>which patients to use TIPS in the treatment of complications of portal <br>hypertension (5-8). According to the previous series of patients treated <br>with TIPS, a major problem of the procedure are shunt tract stenoses which <br>are the result of intimal thickening secondary to pseudointimal hyperplasia <br>(proliferation of dense collagen and myofibroblasts) (9-10). On its genesis <br>biliary-TIPS fistulae have been implied (11,12). Others, however, have <br>demonstrated marked shunt stenoses (dense collagen and smooth muscle cells <br>proliferation) without bile staining or bile duct proliferation (13). In <br>draining hepatic vein stenosis intimal vein hyperplasia can also be <br>observed, which is probably due to traumatic stress during the shunt <br>procedure, high flow after TIPS or activation of smooth muscle cells by <br>growth factors (11-13). As demonstrated in a randomized study, the use of <br>stents coated with polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE) improves TIPS patency <br>and decreases the number of clinical relapses and reinterventions without <br>increasing the risk of encephalopathy (14) compared to bare stents. At this <br>moment all available RCTs used bare stents and their conclusions might be <br>deeply modified by the use of e-PTFE-covered stents (15). With the use of <br>these new devices, the role of TIPS in the management and treatment of the <br>complications of portal hypertension continues to evolve (14, 15) and has <br>been re-evaluated, updating the clinical recommendations for TIPS (8). TIPS <br>and variceal bleeding: At this moment, TIPS is accepted as a second-line <br>therapy and should be used when medical and endoscopic treatment have failed <br>(8). In such circumstances TIPS is able to control bleeding in 89-100% of <br>cases with a re-bleeding rate of 15% and a mortality (first month) of 30% <br>(16-22). It is well known that there are patients with a high degree of <br>rebleeding (30-60% at one year) after medical and endoscopic treatments <br>(23). Therefore patients at a higher risk of re-bleeding need to be detected <br>at an earlier stage. Two studies have identified which parameters, measured <br>in acutely bleeding patients, are predictors of early re-bleeding: <br>portosystemic gradient > 20 mmHg, advanced Child-Pugh class and systemic <br>blood pressure < 100 mmHg (24, 25). According to some authors, limiting the <br>use of TIPS as a rescue therapy in cases of failure of vasoactive drugs and <br>endoscopic therapy needs to be revised and TIPS should be considered as <br>first-line treatment in high-risk selected patients (15). Two recent studies <br>comparing TIPS to surgery (distal splenorenal shunt-DSRS) have been <br>published (26, 27). They have demonstrated that TIPS (with covered <br>prostheses) is as effective as DSRS in preventing variceal re-bleeding and <br>may be more cost effective. It has therefore been said in a recent editorial <br>that “the era of surgical shunting for treatment of portal hypertension is <br>over” (28). TIPS and refractory ascites: Refractory ascites represent <br>another indication for TIPS (29). A review of several RCTs has shown that <br>TIPS was able to significantly reduce not only the risk of recurrence of <br>ascites, but also the mortality rate of patients with refractory ascites <br>when compared with repeated large-volume paracentesis (30). The predictive <br>factors for survival are: age, serum bilirubin and sodium levels. Younger <br>patients with a less compromised liver function and systemic hemodynamics <br>may benefit from TIPS as a first-line treatment for refractory ascites (15). <br>TIPS and Budd-Chiari syndrome: A large study with data obtained from 6 <br>European institutions has collected the long-term followup of 124 patients <br>with Budd-Chiari Syndrome treated with TIPS. Patients were treated with <br>both, non-covered and covered stents. The OLT-free survival was 88% at one <br>year and 78% at 5 years. For them, TIPS should no longer be considered as a <br>bridge to liver transplantation, but the treatment of choice when <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> has failed. Independent risk factors of mortality that have <br>been identi- fied are: age, serum bilirubin levels and INR/PT values (31). <br>TIPS and Portal thrombosis (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>): Some previous reports have shown short <br>series of patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in whom TIPS may be effective for the palliation <br>of symptoms (32). The largest series of patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> with and without <br>cavernomatous transformation has recently been published by Senzolo (33). <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span> is not a contraindication for TIPS anymore and should be considered in <br>patients with severe and life-threatening complications or in whom the <br>thrombus may jeopardize liver transplantation. Even in specialized centres, <br>the success rate in accomplishing the procedure is 73%, which remarks the <br>need to refer those patients to selected units with a large experience in <br>performing TIPS. In summary, the vision of Jösef Rösch who forty years ago <br>envisioned the possibility of performing percutaneous connections between <br>the portal vein and the inferior vena cava is an accepted reality today. <br>TIPS is continuously evolving as an established method of treatment in a <br>wide variety of portal vein complications in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic <br>patients. Although implemented in many institutions throughout the world, <br>some patients with expected difficulties (i.e. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> or Budd-Chiari syndrome) <br>should be referred to especially dedicated centres.<br><br>RECORD 600<br>Predicting thrombotic complications after liver transplantation in patients <br>with Budd Chiari syndrome<br>Westbrook R.

Date of Publication: September 2010<br><br>Introduction: Myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) are the commonest cause of <br>Budd Chiari syndrome (BCS). A somatic mutation of the tyrosine kinase JAK2 <br>gene (JAK2V617F) is present in a large proportion of patients with MPD and <br>is used as a screening tool to detect occult MPD. Recently a germline 46/1 <br>haplotype block and mutations in the TET2 gene have also been implicated in <br>the pathogenesis of MPD. We evaluate whether these underlying genetic <br>abnormalities are relevant to the occurrence of thrombotic complications <br>post liver transplantation (LT). Method: Samples of DNA were extracted from <br>total blood or bone marrow. Real-time PCR was performed to screen for JAK2 <br>mutations. TET2 mutations were analysed by next generation high throughput <br>DNA sequencing (Roche 454). DNA was analysed by pyrosequencing for two SNP's <br>which tag the 46/1 haplotype. Histology of liver biopsies performed for <br>graft dysfunction were reviewed for evidence of veno-occlusive disease <br>(VOD). The INR post LT and patient outcomes were recorded. Results: 36 <br>patients underwent LT for BCS between 1995 and 2008. Median duration of <br>follow-up after LT was 40 months (1-195 months) and 1-year survival was 84%. <br>Pro-coagulant conditions were identified in 22 patients (MPD n=17, Protein C <br>Deficiency n=2, Behcet's n=2 and lupus anti-coagulant n=1). The remaining 14 <br>patients were classed as idiopathic. Overall, 22/36 (61%) were positive for <br>the JAK2 mutation, 6/27 (22%) for the TET2 mutation and 19/26 (73%) for the <br>46/1 haplotype. In the idiopathic cohort, 8/13 (63%) tested positive for <br>JAK2 suggesting latent MPD. All patients were treated with warfarin <br>following LT. Thrombotic complications occurred in 12/36 (33%) and included <br>hepatic artery thrombosis (n=3, 2/3 being late), VOD (n=7), splenic vein <br>thrombosis (n=1) and <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (n=1), at a median time of 40 <br>months post LT (range 1-164 months). Re-transplantation was more common in <br>those with thrombotic complications (7/12 (58%) vs 1/24 (4%), (p=0.0006)) <br>and mortality was higher (4/12, (25%) vs 3/24, (13%)), but this did not <br>reach statistical significance (p=0.2). The presence of a JAK2 mutation was <br>associated with the development of a thrombotic complication post LT (11/12 <br>vs 1/24, p=0.01). Neither the 46/1 haplotype nor the TET2 mutation was <br>associated with an increase in post LT thrombotic complications or <br>morbidity. Mean INR was not significantly different in those patients who <br>developed a thrombotic complication (2.73 vs 2.70, p=NS). Conclusion: A JAK2 <br>mutation appears to be associated with an increased risk of recurrent BCS <br>and other thrombotic complications post LT. Thrombotic complications <br>following LT are associated with an increase in morbidity and mortality. In <br>patients with a JAK2 mutation, the role of additional <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> or <br>JAK2 inhibitor therapy needs to be investigated to try and prevent <br>thrombotic complications.<br><br>RECORD 601<br>Feasibility and long-term evolution of TIPS in cirrhotic patients with <br>portal thrombosis<br>Perarnau J.-M. Baju A. D'Aalteroche L. Viguier J. Ayoub J.<br>European Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2010) 22:9 (1093-1098). <br>Date of Publication: September 2010<br><br>AIM: Many researchers consider portal thrombosis (PT) as a contraindication <br>to transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). The aim of this <br>retrospective study was to compare the feasibility and long-term prognosis <br>of TIPS in cirrhotic patients, with and without, complete PT. PATIENTS AND <br>Methods: Four hundred and thirty-six consecutive cirrhotic patients with <br>portal hypertension were referred for TIPS, between 1990 and 2004. These <br>patients were divided into two groups according to their portal patency. <br>PT+: 34 patients with complete PT with cavernoma (19) or without (15) <br>cavernoma versus PT-: 402 patients with normal portal patency (308) and <br>partial PT (94). Epidemiological data were compared using the χ and <br>Student's t-tests, and comparative evolution was made from actuarial data <br>using the log-rank test. Results: PT+ patients were more frequently women <br>with viral hepatitis, and TIPS was performed more often for bleeding <br>indications. The TIPS success rate was significantly lower in the PT+ group <br>(79%) than in the PT- group (99.5%) (P<10). Presence of a cavernoma <br>decreased the success rate to 63%. TIPS was always feasible in cases of <br>recent PT and portal cavernoma with an accessible intrahepatic patent portal <br>branch. Early and late outcome and complications were not significantly <br>different between the two groups. Conclusion: Complete PT does not modify <br>TIPS' long-term outcome. Rather than a contraindication, PT should be <br>considered as an indication for TIPS in cirrhotic patients with accessible <br>intrahepatic portal vein. Further randomized studies should be planned in <br>cirrhotic patients with recent PT to better qualify TIPS and <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>indications, respectively.

Drug intolerance, instability of VKA therapy and bleeding <br>complications may limit the use of VKA therapy. A change of VKA agents (e. <br>g. phenprocoumon to warfarin) usually assists to avoid such adverse events. <br>For short or intermediate-term <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> a switch to LMWH or <br>fondaparinux is often a suitable alternative.

(3) A <br>52-year-old male with AF, received 10 mg rivaroxaban daily because of <br>coumarin-induced hepatitis. (4) A 42-year-old female with postthrombotic <br>syndrome, recurrent PE and a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and <br>cross-reactivity to danaparoid had been treated with fondaparinux for <br>intolerance of phenprocoumon and warfarin. When developing intolerance of <br>also fondaparinux we switched her to rivaroxaban, 10 mg daily. Results: No <br>further adverse event occur in any of the four patients.

Date of Publication: <br>September 2010<br><br>Pylephlebitis or septic thrombophlebitis of the portomesenteric veins is a <br>complication of intra-abdominal infections. The disease is rare in children <br>and the diagnosis is often delayed. The morbidity of pylephlebitis is <br>relatively low, although there is a risk of residual thrombosis. We report <br>on 2 cases of pylephlebitis in a 12-year-old girl and a 13-year-old boy, <br>following undiagnosed appendicitis.

Maehara Y.<br>Liver Transplantation (2010) 16 SUPPL. 1 (S188)<br><br>(Purpose) <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) after liver transplantation (LT) is a <br>relatively common but serious complication which could lead to portal <br>hypertension or a direct graft loss. A “Rex” shunt created between the <br>superior mesenteric vein (SMV) and the umbilical portion (UP) of the liver <br>can be a useful option to treat <span style="color: red">PVT</span> after living donor liver transplantation <br>(LDLT) but few have been reported so far. We present a case of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> after <br>LDLT who underwent the procedures using the own inferior jugular vein (IJV) <br>and the gonadal vein (GV) as a shunt graft. (Methods) The patient was a <br>46-year-old female who developed <span style="color: red">PVT</span> at 2 months after ABO-incompatible, <br>left lobe LDLT for giant hemangioma of the liver. An 8cm-long left IJV and a <br>5cm-long, enlarged GV were procured for venous grafts. The IJV and GV were <br>independently anastomosed endto- side to the infrapancreatic SMV and the <br>U-portion of the left lobe graft, respectively. The two venous grafts were <br>then anastomosed end-to-end and reperfused, which resulted in resumed <br>hepatopetal portal fl ow in the liver. (Results) The operative time was <br>8.5hrs and the blood loss was 482ml. The shunt was patent immediately after <br>the procedures but was thrombosed 2 days after the procedures probably due <br>to the insufficient infl ow from the SMV and the absence of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>therapy, for which emergent thrombectomy and ligation of the additional <br>collateral veins followed by full anti-coagulation therapy were performed. <br>The shunt remains open at 3 month after the procedure with a normal anmonia <br>level and liver function. (Conclusion) “Rex” shunt using a donor's own vein <br>graft is a feasible and valuable option to treat <span style="color: red">PVT</span> after adult LDLT.<br><br>RECORD 610<br>Predicting thrombotic complications after liver transplantation in patients <br>with Budd Chiari Syndrome<br>Westbrook R.

Heneghan M.<br>Liver Transplantation (2010) 16 SUPPL. 1 (S72)<br><br>Background: Myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) are the commonest cause of <br>Budd Chiari Syndrome (BCS). The presence of a JAK2 mutation in “idiopathic” <br>BCS is used as a screening tool to identify latent MPD. Recently a germline <br>46/1 haplotype block and mutations in the TET2 gene have been implicated in <br>the pathogenesis of MPD. We evaluate the incidence and clinical relevance of <br>these genetic abnormalities in patients transplanted for BCS. Real time PCR <br>was performed to screen for JAK2 mutations. TET2 mutations were analysed by <br>next generation high throughput DNA sequencing (Roche 454). DNA was analysed <br>by pyrosequencing for 2 SNP's which tag the 46/1 haplotype. Histology of <br>liver biopsies performed for graft dysfunction to identify venoocclusive <br>disease (VOD), mean INR and patient outcome were recorded. Results: Thirty <br>six patients underwent LT for BCS between 1995 and 2008. Median duration of <br>follow-up after LT was 40 months (1-195 months) and 1 year survival was 84%. <br>Pro-coagulant conditions were identified in 22 patients (MPD n=17, Protein C <br>Deficiency n=2, Behcet's n=2 and lupus anticoagulant n=1), 14 patients were <br>labelled idiopathic. Overall, 22/36 (61%) had the JAK2 mutation (8/13 in the <br>idiopathic cohort), 6/27 (22%) the TET2 mutation and 19/26 (73%) the 46/1 <br>haplotype. All patients received warfarin following LT. Thrombotic <br>complications occurred in 12/36 (33%) and included hepatic artery thrombosis <br>(n=3, 2/3 late), VOD (n=7), splenic and <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (n=2), at a <br>median time of 40 months post LT (range 1-164 months). The JAK2 mutation was <br>associated with thrombotic complications post LT (11/12 vs. 1/24, p=0.01), <br>but the 46/1 haplotype and the TET2 mutation wern't. Thrombotic <br>complications were associated with re-transplantation (7/12 (58%) vs. 1/24 <br>(4%), p=0.0006) and increased mortality (4/12, (25%) vs. 3/24, (13%), <br>p=0.2). Mean INR was not significantly different in patients who developed a <br>thrombotic complication (2.73 vs. 2.70, p=NS). Conclusions: A JAK2 mutation <br>is associated with an increased risk of thrombotic complications post LT. In <br>patients with a JAK2 mutation the role of additional <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> or JAK2 <br>inhibitor therapy should be investigated to try and prevent thrombotic <br>complications.<br><br>RECORD 611<br>Venous thrombotic emergencies<br>DeLoughery T.G.<br>Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2010) 24:3 (487-500).

Date of Publication: <br>June 2010<br><br>Disorders of coagulation are common adverse drug events encountered in <br>critically ill patients and present a serious concern for intensive care <br>unit (ICU) clinicians. Dosing strategies for medications used in the ICU are <br>typically developed for use in noncritically ill patients and, therefore, do <br>not account for the altered pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties <br>encountered in the critically ill as well as the increased potential for <br>drug-drug interactions, given the far greater number of medications ordered. <br>This substantially increases the risk for coagulation-related adverse <br>reactions, such as a bleeding or prothrombotic events. Although many <br>medications used in the ICU have the potential to cause coagulation <br>disorders, the exact incidence will vary based on the specific medication, <br>dose, concomitant drug therapy, ICU setting, and patient-specific <br>comorbidities.

Bergeron J. Pant N. Patel N. Nasser W.<br>American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2010) 181:1 <br>MeetingAbstracts. Date of Publication: 1 May 2010<br><br>Introduction: Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) is one of the frequent reasons for <br>admission, so is acute pancreatitis (AP). AP also is one of the <br>manifestations of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) whereas visceral vein <br>thrombosis can be a complication of AP. We report a case of 19-yr old female <br>who presented with DKA and was found to have AP along with portal, splenic <br>and mesenteric vein thrombosis. Case Report: A 19 year old AAF, known case <br>of Multiple sclerosis, Diabetes Mellitus presented with complains of nausea, <br>vomiting and abdominal pain for three days. She also gave history of <br>constipation for two days. Past medical history was negative for <br>pancreatitis, venous or arterial thrombosis. Physical examination revealed <br>dehydration, tender abdomen and absent bowel sounds. Initial labs showed <br>blood sugar of 560 mg/dl, anion gap of 26 and urine and serum positive for <br>ketone. Patient also had elevated lipase (534) and amylase (224). Patient <br>was started on treatment for DKA and Pancreatitis. CT abdomen was done which <br>showed pancreatic necrosis, hepatic infarction along with portal, splenic <br>and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis. CT was negative for gall stones. <br>Patient was started on <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> for her <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. <br>Causes for hypercoagulability were sought and she was found to be positive <br>for lupus anticoagulant. Anticardiolipin antibody, Antiglycoprotein <br>antibody, ANA and RA were negative. Patient improved with treatment. Repeat <br>CT scans showed patency of her visceral veins. She was discharged home in <br>stable condition. Discussion: The relationship between DKA and AP has been <br>sought. AP coexisting with DKA as a cause or result has been reported <br>previously. As per literature DKA may mask a coexisting AP, which occurs in <br>nearly 10-15 % of cases. This case underlines the importance of careful <br>consideration of AP in cases of DKA especially if initial presentation <br>includes severe abdominal pain. One of the rare causes for AP is APS. On <br>other hand AP is also considered a cause for visceral vein thrombosis <br>especially <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. Our lady had AP in her presentation and <br>CT scan showed visceral vein thrombosis. She was later found to be positive <br>for lupus anticoagulant. We don't know which one among these two was <br>precipitating cause, but this case suggests consideration of APS and <br>visceral vein thrombosis in case of AP as early initiation of <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in visceral vein thrombosis has shown to improve outcome. No <br>relationship between DKA and APS was found in literature.<br><br>RECORD 615<br>The management of pregnancy in paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria on long <br>term eculizumab<br>Kelly R.

Safety and efficacy of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> have never been <br>prospectively tested for its prevention. We therefore designed a prospective <br>randomized trial of anticoagulant therapy in advanced cirrhotic patients to <br>verify whether it can prevent <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and improve course of disease and survival <br>(Eudract 2007-007890-22). Methods: Cirrhotic patients, Child B7-C10, were <br>randomized to receive enoxaparin 4000 IU/die or placebo for 12 months <br>followed by 12 months observation. US was performed every 3 months and CT <br>every 6 months to check for portal vein axis. <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was considered as relevant <br>event when it was either complete or involved more than 50% of portal vein <br>diameter and was symptomatic (partial <span style="color: red">PVT</span>). Primary aim of the study was <br>evaluation of efficacy in preventing <span style="color: red">PVT</span>; secondary aims were assessment of <br>safety of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, effect on occurrence of decompensation and/or <br>survival. Results: We report the events of the 51 patients (26 randomized to <br>treatment and 25 to placebo) who completed 24 months of observation. No <br>relevant side effects, in particular no hemorrhagic events, were <br>attributable to the active drug.

However, after BPD with distal gastrectomy <br>patients with CBD stones require either repeat surgery or PTC, the former <br>particularly inconvenient after cholecystectomy. We offer a novel endoscopic <br>approach in this setting, illustrated by the case of a 72 y.o. female with <br>symptomatic proven residual CBD stones after BPD. Endoscopic methods: A <br>3-step endoscopic treatment was carried out: 1) EUS-guided <br>hepatico-gastrostomy using a 10mm biliary covered SEMS; 2) Peroral <br>cholangioscopy & lithotripsy (EHL) with a 5.2mm pediatric gastroscope thru <br>the transhepatic fistula 4 weeks later, after removal of the c-SEMS. Stone <br>fragment evacuation was achieved via another temporary transpapillary <br>biliary c-SEMS, while mantaining the fistula patent with a second <br>transhepatic c-SEMS; and 3) Transhepatic fluoroscopy-guided final stone <br>clearance & stent removal.

There is no established management algorithm for the treatment of <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span> and SVT in patients with <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span>. The aim of the study was to <br>evaluate prospectically an integrated algorithm for the treatment of this <br>condition, integrating the use of radiological treatment when failure of <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> occurred. Methods: All patients who were referred to our <br>department with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> or SVT from February 2006 were included in the study. <br>Patients with history of portal vein or splancnic vein thrombosis in the <br>same period but not included in the protocol were used as control group. <br>Screening for prothrombotic disordes and local risk factors was performed in <br>all patients. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was considered in all and contraindicated when <br>high risk of bleeding from varices persist and stabilized presence of <br>cavernous transformation of portal vein with recanalization of intrhepatic <br>portal vein branches. All patients who were at risk of bleeding from varices <br>were banded first. Transjugulat intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) was <br>indicated when there were concomitant presence of portal hypertensive <br>complications or there was progression of thrombosis, or <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was <br>contraindicated. Results: 45 cirrhotics were included in the protocol, 34 <br>males, mean age 55.5±5, Chils score was distributed as follows: 14 Child C, <br>22 Child B, 9 Child A. At the moment of inclusion 20 had total portal vein <br>thrombosis (9 cavernoma) and 22 partial <span style="color: red">PVT</span>; amongst them 2 splenic vein <br>thrombosis, 6 SMV thrombosis and 5 total splancninc thrombosis were <br>associated; 3 isolated SMV Prothrombotic systemic conditions or local <br>factors were identified in 7 patients (15%): 5 prothrombotic genetic <br>defects. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was initiated in 39 patients, 4 with intraveous <br>infusion of LWMH for acute <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Twenty patients, 14 males, 9 with complete <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span> (4 cavernoma) were used as controls. Mean follow-up ±SD was 17±3 months <br>for the study group and 20±4 months for the control group. Sixteen over 39 <br>(38%) who were anticoagulated had ricanalization of the thrombosed vessels, <br>compared to none of the controls and the non coagulated patients (p < <br>0.001). During the follow-up there were progression of thrombosis in 15/26 <br>patients non anticoagulated and control group and in 1 amongst <br>anticoagulated patients (p < 0.001). Only age of thrombus was correlated <br>with occurrence of repermeation. TIPS was indicated in 11 patients, and <br>successfully placed in 10 without complications.

Methods: From May 2007 to April 2009 we <br>recorded all cirrhotic patients developing a nonneoplastic portal <br>thrombosis. Presence and size of esophageal or gastric varices were assessed <br>in all patients by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGE). Anticoagulant <br>treatment was initiated and patients followed with US to assess the response <br>to therapy. Results: Sixteen patients with cirrhosis and not neoplastic <br>portal thrombosis were observed. Cirrhosis was due to HCV in 6, HBV in 2, <br>ALD in 3 and was cryptogenetic in 5. UGE found F1 varices in 6, F2 in 6 and <br>F3 in 4. All patients with large varices were treated prophylactically with <br>beta-blockers or variceal band ligation. Anticoagulant drugs used were low <br>weight molecular heparin (LWMH) in 7, warfarin in 4 and LMWH later converted <br>to warfarin in 5. Extension of thrombus after starting <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was <br>never observed, and a significant reduction in its size was observed in 15 <br>out of 16. Five patients achieved complete recanalization of the portal <br>vessels after a mean treatment of 12 months (range 6-16). No patients <br>experienced adverse events linked to anticoagulants and no instances of GI <br>bleeding occurred. There were no significant differences in the varices size <br>or anticoagulant treatment between patients with partial or complete <br>recanalization of portal vein. Conclusions: Patients with cirrhosis, portal <br>hypertension and nonneoplastic portal thrombosis may benefit of <br>anticoagulants for the treatment of the thrombosis without development of <br>SAE.

Lauter C.<br>Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010) 125:2 SUPPL. 1 (AB153). <br>Date of Publication: February 2010<br><br>RATIONALE: There are four types of cutaneous reactions with warfarin: <br>purpura, hemorrhagic necrosis, purple toe syndrome, and urticaria. <br>Urticarial eruptions are rarest. A previous study noted evidence of <br>immunologic involvement. The role of IgE remains uncertain; skin testing is <br>unavailable. No desensitization procedure has been published. METHODS: Five <br>patients were evaluated. Based on history, examination and positive <br>challenge, two patients underwent oral desensitization. Desensitization <br>utilized dye-free Coumadin® starting with 0.005mg dose. At 15-minute <br>intervals, the dose was advanced to 1mg. Three patients with less well <br>documented reactions underwent graded drug challenge with dye-free <br>Coumadin®. RESULTS: A 66 year-old female developed pruritic, generalized <br>urticaria after starting on warfarin for atrial fibrillation (AF). The <br>symptoms partially improved with Medrol®, but not with antihistamines. She <br>had persistent hives for over two years with continued use. After warfarin <br>was discontinued, her urticaria resolved. Subsequently, she needed AF <br>ablation therapy and underwent successful desensitization with Coumadin®.A <br>30 year-old female with <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> received warfarin. Within <br>hours, she developed pruritic urticaria which resolved with diphenhydramine. <br>Warfarin intake was interrupted for INR elevation. Reintroduction resulted <br>in diffuse urticaria and lip angioedema. She was successfully desensitized <br>with Coumadin®. Three patients underwent graded drug challenge with dye-free <br>(10mg) Coumadin®, starting with 0.5mg with a target dose of 5mg. They <br>tolerated the challenge and subsequent therapy with the same product. <br>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with warfarin allergy who require oral <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>may be managed in a supervised graded drug challenge with dyefree Coumadin® <br>or desensitization in a controlled setting if drug challenge is positive.<br><br>RECORD 629<br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span><br>Parikh S.

Date of <br>Publication: February 2010<br><br>Aliment Pharmacol Ther 31, 366-374 SummaryBackground As current imaging <br>techniques in cirrhosis allow detection of asymptomatic portal vein <br>thrombosis during routine ultrasonography, more patients with cirrhosis are <br>diagnosed with <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. Although a consensus on noncirrhotic <br>extra-hepatic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> has been published, no such consensus <br>exists for <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> with cirrhosis. Aim To perform a <br>systematic review of nonmalignant <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in cirrhosis in <br>terms of prevalence, pathogenesis, diagnosis, clinical course and <br>management. Methods Studies were identified by a search strategy using <br>MEDLINE and EMBASE. Results <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> is encountered in 10-25% <br>of cirrhotics. In terms of pathophysiology, cirrhosis is no longer <br>considered a hypocoagulable state; rather than a bleeding risk in cirrhosis, <br>various clinical studies support a thrombotic potential. Clinical findings <br>of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in cirrhosis vary from asymptomatic disease to a <br>life-threatening condition at first presentation. Optimal management of <br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in cirrhosis is currently not addressed in any <br>consensus publication. Treatment strategies most often include the use of <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, while thrombectomy and transjugular intrahepatic <br>portosystemic shunts are considered second-line options. Conclusions Portal <br>vein thrombosis in cirrhosis has many unresolved issues, which are often the <br>critical problems clinicians encounter in their everyday practice. We <br>propose a possible research agenda to address these unresolved issues. © <br>2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.<br><br>RECORD 632<br>Venous Thromboembolism in Children<br>Goldenberg N.A.

Date of <br>Publication: January 2010<br><br>BACKGROUND: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is a complication following <br>splenectomy, but not reported post liver transplantation (LT). We describe a <br>case of acute post-splenectomy <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in a LT recipient which was successfully <br>treated with pharmacomechanical thrombolysis using the Trellis device. CASE <br>REPORT: A 54 year old LT recipient presented two years later with <br>symptomatic splenomegaly and underwent an uncomplicated splenectomy. He <br>developed complete <span style="color: red">PVT</span> within 24 hours postoperatively, sparing the superior <br>mesenteric vein. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was initiated. Complete thrombosis of the <br>intrahepatic portal vein branches precluded percutaneous cannulation of the <br>portal system. Hence the portal vein (PV) was cannulated intraoperatively <br>through a jejunal branch. Tissue Plasminogen Activator (t-PA) was injected <br>and partial recanalization of the main PV was achieved which was <br>subsequently accessed trans-hepatically via right internal jugular vein <br>puncture. A Trellis 8 (Bacchus Vascular, Santa Clara, CA) thrombolysis <br>device was used and resulted in significant improvement of PV flow. This was <br>followed by 24 hour continuous direct infusion of tPA and systemic <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. Repeat imaging studies demonstrated re-canalization of the <br>PV system. CONCLUSIONS: <span style="color: red">PVT</span> after splenectomy has been reported in the <br>literature, but not in the setting of LT.

Date of Publication: January 2010<br><br>Current recommendations for early <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in acute portal vein <br>thrombosis unrelated to cirrhosis or malignancy are based on limited <br>evidence. The aim of this study was to prospectively assess the risk <br>factors, outcome, and prognosis in patients managed according to these <br>recommendations. We enrolled 102 patients with acute thrombosis of the <br>portal vein, or its left or right branch. Laboratory investigations for <br>prothrombotic factors were centralized. Thrombus extension and <br>recanalization were assessed by expert radiologists. A local risk factor was <br>identified in 21% of patients, and one or several general prothrombotic <br>conditions in 52%. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was given to 95 patients. After a median <br>of 234 days, the portal vein and its left or right branch were patent in 39% <br>of anticoagulated patients (versus 13% initially), the splenic vein in 80% <br>(versus 57% initially), and the superior mesenteric vein in 73% (versus 42% <br>initially). Failure to recanalize the portal vein was independently related <br>to the presence of ascites (hazard ratio 3.8, 95% confidence interval <br>1.3-11.1) and an occluded splenic vein (hazard ratio 3.5, 95% confidence <br>interval 1.4-8.9). Gastrointestinal bleeding and intestinal infarction <br>occurred in nine and two patients, respectively. Two patients died from <br>causes unrelated to thrombosis or <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy. Conclusion: <br>Recanalization occurs in one-third of patients receiving early <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> for acute <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>, whereas thrombus <br>extension, intestinal infarction, severe bleeding, and death are rare. <br>Alternative therapy should be considered when ascites and splenic vein <br>obstruction are present.

Methods: A <br>total of 116 cirrhotic patients admitted to our hospital from June 2006 to <br>October 2008 were included in our study. All patients were classified into <br>two groups: <span style="color: red">PVT</span> group (31 patients), composed of patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and a <br>control group (85 patients), including patients without <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Platelet, <br>prothrombin time (PT), activated partial prothrombin time (APTT) and <br>fibrinogen were measured. Also, plasma samples from the patients were <br>analyzed for the levels of antithrombin III (AT-III), protein C (PC), <br>protein S (PS), D-dimer, tissue-type plasminogen activator as well as <br>plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Statistical analyses were carried out to <br>evaluate the correlation of specific variations with the disease status. <br>Results: In general, the higher Child-Pugh scores, indicating the <br>aggravation of hepatic impairment of the patients, correlated well with the <br>prolonged PT/APTT and increased D-dimer, as well as decreased platelet, <br>fibrinogen, PC and AT-III levels in the serum. Furthermore, we found that <br>the PC, PS and D-dimer levels in <span style="color: red">PVT</span> patients were 2.32 ± 0.72 mg/L, 17.14 ± <br>3.62 mg/L and 0.99 ± 0.36 mg/L, respectively, both representing a <br>significant difference compared with those in the control group without <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. <br>Logistic regression model shows that the odds ratio value of one unit of <br>increase of PC and D-dimer were 0.48 and 15.57. Conclusions: Cirrhotic <br>patients displayed dysfunctions in the coagulation, anti-coagulation and <br>fibrolytic systems. The development of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in these patients may be <br>independently associated with the decrease of PC, PS and D-dimer. <br>Furthermore, decreasing PC and increasing D-dimer may be risk factors <br>inducing <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in cirrhotic patients. © 2009 Journal of Gastroenterology and <br>Hepatology Foundation and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.<br><br>RECORD 636<br>Rare thromboses of cerebral, splanchnic and upper-extremity veins: A <br>narrative review<br>Martinelli I. De Stefano V.<br>Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2010) 103:6 (1136-1144). Date of Publication: <br>June 2010<br><br>Venous thrombosis typically involves the lower extremity circulation. <br>Rarely, it can occur in the cerebral or splanchnic veins and these are the <br>most frightening manifestations because of their high mortality rate. A <br>third site of rare venous thrombosis is the deep system of the upper <br>extremities that, as for the lower extremity, can be complicated by <br>pulmonary embolism and post-thrombotic syndrome. The authors conducted a <br>narrative review focused on clinical manifestations, risk factors, and <br>treatment of rare venous thromboses. Local risk factors such as infections <br>or cancer are frequent in thrombosis of cerebral or portal veins. Upper <br>extremity deep-vein thrombosis is mostly due to local risk factors <br>(catheter- or effort-related). Common systemic risk factors for rare venous <br>thromboses are inherited thrombophilia and oral contraceptive use; chronic <br>myeloproliferative neoplasms are closely associated with splanchnic vein <br>thrombosis. In the acute phase rare venous thromboses should be treated <br>conventionally with low-molecular-weight heparin. Use of local or systemic <br>fibrinolysis should be considered in the case of clinical deterioration in <br>spite of adequate <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> with vitamin <br>K-antagonists is recommended for 3-6 months after a first episode of rare <br>venous thrombosis. Indefinite <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> is recommended for Budd-Chiari <br>syndrome, recurrent thrombosis or unprovoked thrombosis and permanent risk <br>factors. In conclusion, the progresses made in the last couple of decades in <br>diagnostic imaging and the broadened knowledge of thrombophilic <br>abnormalities improved the recognition of rare venous thromboses and the <br>understanding of pathogenic mechanisms.

Date of Publication: <br>June 2010<br><br>Purpose: We report thrombosis of portal and mesenteric veins in patients <br>with a pattern of rectal venous malformations (VMs) and ectatic major <br>mesenteric veins. Methods: Eight patients having rectal VMs with either <br>ectatic mesenteric veins and/or evidence of portomesenteric venous <br>thrombosis (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>), evaluated from 1995-2009, were reviewed. Results: <br>Portomesenteric venous thrombosis was evident in 5 patients at presentation. <br>Three had patent ectatic mesenteric veins, 2 with demonstrated reversal of <br>flow, and 2 of whom went on to thrombosis during observation. Six patients <br>developed portal hypertension.

Conclusion: Rectal VMs should be evaluated for <br>associated ectatic mesenteric veins. The ectatic vein siphons flow from the <br>portal vein down to the rectal VM, leading to stagnation of blood in the <br>portal vein and resultant thrombosis.

AIM: We intended to assess the safety and <br>efficacy of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) to treat <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in cirrhotic <br>patients. Study: All 39 patients diagnosed with non-neoplastic <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and <br>cirrhosis from June 2005 to December 2006 were evaluated for <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>therapy (AT). <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was occludent in 15.4%, partial in 64.1%, and portal <br>cavernoma presented in 20.5%. Twenty-eight patients received 200 U/kg/d of <br>enoxaparin for at least 6 months. In 39.3% of patients <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was an occasional <br>finding, in 10.7% presented with acute abdominal pain, in 50% with bleeding <br>from gastroesophageal varices. In this last group LMWH was started after <br>endoscopic eradication of varices by band ligation. Results: Complete <br>recanalization of portal vein occurred in 33.3%, partial recanalization in <br>50% and no response in 16.7% of patients. Further 12 patients who continued <br>AT obtained complete recanalization at a median time of 11 months (range 7 <br>to 17 mo). Overall, a complete response was obtained in 75% of patients.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: There is no standard treatment for <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>after splenectomy in <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span>. METHODS: A total of 50 consecutive <br>cirrhotic patients who underwent laparoscopic splenectomy for hypersplenism <br>were enrolled into this study. From January 2005 to December 2005, 25 <br>cirrhotic patients received no prophylactic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy after <br>the operation (AT-III group). From January 2006 to July 2006, 25 cirrhotic <br>patients received prophylactic administration of AT-III concentrates (1500 <br>U/d) on postoperative day (POD) 1, 2, and 3 (AT-III [+] group). RESULTS: In <br>AT-III (-) group, 9 (36.0%) patients developed <span style="color: red">PVT</span> up to POD 7, and risk <br>factors for <span style="color: red">PVT</span> were identified as: low platelet counts, low AT-III <br>activity, and increased spleen weight. Although there were no significant <br>differences in the clinical characteristics, including the above risk <br>factors, between the 2 groups, only 1 (4.0%) patient developed <span style="color: red">PVT</span> on POD 30 <br>in AT-III (+) group, and the incidence of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was significantly lower than <br>in AT-III (-) group (P = 0.01). In AT-III (-) group, AT-III activity was <br>significantly decreased from POD 1 to POD 7, as compared with the <br>preoperative level, whereas AT-III concentrates prevented the postoperative <br>decrease in AT-III activity. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that low <br>AT-III activity and further decreases in this activity are associated with <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span> after splenectomy in cirrhotic patients, and that treatment with AT-III <br>concentrates is likely to prevent the development of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in these patients. <br>Copyright © 2009 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.<br><br>RECORD 641<br>Recommended timing for surveillance ultrasonography to diagnose portal <br>splenic vein thrombosis after laparoscopic splenectomy<br>Tran T.

Date of Publication: July 2010<br><br>Background Symptomatic portal or splenic vein thrombosis (PSVT) is a rare <br>but potentially lethal complication of laparoscopic splenectomy (LS). While <br>routine postoperative duplex ultrasound surveillance can be used for early <br>detection, the optimal timing is unknown. The aim of this study is to <br>investigate the incidence and progression of asymptomatic PSVT 1 week and 1 <br>month after LS. Methods Consecutive patients scheduled for LS for <br>hematologic disease participated in this study. Patients underwent <br>surveillance for PSVT using duplex ultrasonography 1 week and 1 month <br>postoperatively. Results 43 of 48 patients planning to undergo LS in the <br>study period were enrolled, with 3 subsequently excluded, leaving 40 for <br>further analysis. The indications for LS were benign disease in 31 [19 had <br>immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP)] and malignant disease in 9. A <br>hand-assisted technique was used in 12 cases. PSVT was diagnosed in 9/40 <br>patients (22.5%). Seven (77.8%) were diagnosed by 1 week with ultrasound, of <br>whom one had mild symptoms (fever and diarrhea). After <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, <br>subsequent ultrasounds showed resolution or improvement in all seven <br>patients. Thirty-three patients had a normal ultrasound result at 1 week. <br>One of these patients also had a computed tomography (CT) scan that found a <br>PSVT not seen on ultrasound. Twenty-seven patients returned for follow-up <br>after normal 1-week imaging: 26 patients had an ultrasound at 1 month, with <br>no new PSVT found. One additional patient did not return for subsequent <br>ultrasound until 2 months later, when a new distal SVT was found; ultrasound <br>at 6 months showed complete resolution without treatment. Conclusion The <br>1-week incidence of PSVT after LS was 8/40 (20%). The high incidence <br>justifies ultrasonographic screening on postoperative day 7. If asymptomatic <br>PSVT has not developed at this time, it is unlikely to develop by 1 month, <br>and subsequent screening ultrasound at 1 month is not required. © Springer <br>Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.<br><br>RECORD 642<br>Outcome of patients with primary hepatic venous obstruction treated with <br>anticoagulants alone.<br>Shukla A.

Date of Publication: Jan 2010<br><br>BACKGROUND: Outcome of patients with hepatic venous outflow tract <br>obstruction (HVOTO) has improved with newer treatments, including <br>anticoagulants, radiological interventions and liver transplant. In India, <br>however, liver transplant and radiological interventions are costly and have <br>limited availability. Hence, patients often opt for <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> alone. <br>We followed up a group of such patients to determine the clinical outcome <br>with such treatment. METHODS: Consecutive patients with HVOTO, treated with <br>oral <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> and supportive medical therapy but no radiological or <br>surgical intervention, were followed up for at least 12 months. Diagnosis of <br>HVOTO was based on color Doppler, and either angiography or magnetic <br>resonance venography. Warfarin dose was adjusted to maintain international <br>normalized ratio (INR) between 2.0 and 3.0. Patients with secondary HVOTO <br>and those with baseline INR > or = 2.0 were excluded. Response was defined <br>as absence of ascites and/or encephalopathy, normal AST/ALT, bilirubin <1.5 <br>mg/dL, and no portal hypertension related bleed after starting therapy. <br>RESULTS: Of 43 patients (mean [SD] age=28.7 [8.4] years; 20 men), 26 (61%) <br>had a response during a median follow up of 23 (range 15-33) months. The <br>response first appeared within 2 months of the start of treatment in 18 <br>patients and between 2 and 5 months from the start of treatment in eight <br>patients. Seven patients died of progressive liver failure (6 patients) or <br>GI bleed (1 patient). Nine patients had <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>-related <br>complications. On univariate analysis, short duration of symptoms, high <br>serum albumin, low baseline INR, and low baseline Child-Pugh's (CP) or <br>Clichy scores predicted response. Presence of hepatic encephalopathy, portal <br>vein thrombosis, obstruction of all hepatic veins, low albumin, high INR, <br>high serum bilirubin, high baseline CP score, Murad score and adverse Clichy <br>index were associated with higher mortality rate. However, on multivariate <br>analysis, only low CP score was associated with response, and no factor was <br>found to predict death. CONCLUSIONS: More than half of patients with HVOTO <br>show response with only supportive medical therapy and anticoagulants. This <br>occurs more often in patients with low CP score. Some patients may have <br>delayed response.<br><br>RECORD 643<br>Portal, splenic and mesenteric vein thrombosis in a patient double <br>heterozygous for factor v Leiden and prothrombin G20210A mutation<br>Grouzi E.

Extrahepatal portal vein obstruction occurs mainly as a <br>complication of intraabdominal infection, malignancy and hypercoagulable <br>syndromes. Pyogenic thrombophlebitis with subsequent thrombus embolisation <br>into intrahepatic branches of the portal vein may cause multiple liver <br>abscesses. Case report. A 67-year-old man was admitted for clinical <br>presentation of acute abdomen and the diagnosis of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> <br>and multiple liver abscesses was made. The patient was treated succesfully <br>in the intensive care unit with anticoagulants and antibiotics together with <br>CT guided drainage. Surgery was avoided. This therapy resulted in complete <br>regression of liver abscesses. Discussion. We have found a sigmoid <br>diverticulosis on the abdominal CT in our patient, and we pressume possible <br>occult diverticulitis with pylephlebitis as the aetiologic factor. The <br>malignancy or hypercoagulable state were excluded. Pylephlebitis is an <br>ascendent septic portal vein infection in the course of the abdominal <br>sepsis. The subsequent <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> is rare but it is accompanied <br>with high morbidity and mortality. The treatment modality is the drainage of <br>liver abscesses with antibiotics together with anticoagulants. The benefit <br>of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy outweighs the risk of possible bleeding from <br>esophageal or gastric varices. Conclusions. This serious condition <br>demonstrated as an acute abdomen was successfully treated conservatively due <br>to early use of proper imaging methods and appropriate therapy.<br><br>RECORD 645<br>Idiopathic suppurative pylephlebitis: Interventional radiological diagnosis <br>and management<br>Bogue C.O.

Date of Publication: <br>November 2009<br><br>Beginning in 2004, dalteparin doses based on activated clotting time (ACT) <br>were administered for hepatic vessel thrombosis prophylaxis in living donor <br>liver transplantation (LDLT). We verified the feasibility of this new <br>therapy by comparing it with the previous one. From 1993 through 2008, 42 <br>metabolic liver patients who underwent LDLT were divided into two groups. <br>Group A (1993-2003, n = 32) was administered a fixed dalteparin dose and a <br>large amount of fresh frozen plasma (FFP); Group B (2004-2008, n = 10) was <br>administered an appropriate dosage of dalteparin to maintain the ACT levels <br>from 140 to 150 seconds and a small amount of FFP.

We <br>describe a technical variant where the autologous internal jugular vein <br>(IJV) was too short to bridge the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) and the Rex <br>recessus. Patient: A 15-year-old boy with portal cavernoma had several <br>episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding despite repeated sclerotherapy. <br>Preoperative assessment, including retrograde transjugular portography, <br>showed persistent esophageal and gastric varices, severe hypertensive <br>gastropathy, obstructed portal vein, patent SMV and splenomesenteric <br>confluence, patent intrahepatic portal branches, and normal transhepatic <br>pressure gradient. An MRS was planned. The left IJV was retrieved from its <br>infracranial part to its confluence with subclavian vein. After performing <br>the Rex recessus to IJV graft anastomosis, the IJV graft proved to be too <br>short for classical end-to-side anastomosis onto the SMV. After clamp <br>testing showing good tolerance of the small bowel, the proximal jejunal <br>branches of the SMV were tied, the proximal SMV was mobilized and <br>transsected 4 cm below the pancreas, and an end-to-end anastomosis between <br>SMV and IJV was performed.

With the development of new surgical techniques, living <br>donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has recently been recognized as a viable <br>but challenging treatment option for PC. The purpose of the present study <br>was to summarize the efficacy of LDLT in PC patients and to carry out a <br>follow-up study of pediatric recipients. Methods: The primary indication for <br>LDLT in our research was PC with severe variceal bleeding and liver function <br>decompensation. Three patients were diagnosed with PC following evaluation <br>with computed tomography angiography and abdominal color Doppler <br>ultrasonography (CDU). Results: Various surgical techniques, including jump <br>bypass grafting for portal vein anastomosis, were carried out according to <br>the range and degree of cavernous transformation within the splenic vein and <br>superior mesenteric vein. Postoperative CDU confirmed the early integrity of <br>the portal vein (PV) in each patient. PV rethrombosis occurred in one <br>patient 7days after LDLT, despite <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy with coumadin. Two <br>of the three patients had no further episodes of variceal hemorrhage during <br>the 2-year follow-up period. Conclusions: The present study is the first <br>report of the successful use of LDLT to treat pediatric PC patients.

Early <br>HAT typically results in graft failure. Late HAT features biliary <br>obstruction, cholangitis, and hepatic abscess formation. We report here the <br>case of a patient of Wilson's disease who presented twelve years post-liver <br>transplant symptoms typical of acute HAT and hepatic infarction.

Date <br>of Publication: October 2009<br><br>Introduction: Portal thrombosis is a rare disease, but early treatments are <br>important. When the thrombus obstructs the main portal vein rapidly, it <br>causes liver failures. We studied the patients with portal thrombosis of <br>acute biliary infection in our hospital. Materials and Methods: We studied <br>four cases, three cases were cho-ledocholithiasis and one was <br>pancreaticobiliary maljunction. All cases were immediately treated <br>transpapillary or percutaneously, and used anticoagulant drugs. Results: <br>Four cases were recognized moderate or severe acute cholangi-tis, and <br>moderate acute cholecystitis. Thrombus was recognized at right branch of <br>portal vein in four cases. In one case, thrombus was recognized at bilateral <br>branch. After <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy, thrombus was reduced in two cases. <br>Collateral vessels developed slightly in one of the unchanged case at right <br>branch of portal vein. The mean number of WBC and CRP were 13750 and 40.6 <br>mg/dL in the unchanged cases on admission. But in the recovered cases were <br>8000 and 4.7 mg/dL. Conclusion: Direct inflammation of acute biliary <br>infections made severe thrombus at right branch of portal vein. Blood fows <br>of left branch were continued. Then collateral vessels developed slightly in <br>the unchanged cases. In the thrombus cases, the inflammations on admission <br>were severe.

Kessler L.<br>CardioVascular and Interventional Radiology (2009) 32 SUPPL. 2 (261-262). <br>Date of Publication: September 2009<br><br>Type 1 dependent diabetes mellitus (T1D) is consecutive to loss of insulin <br>production due to autoimmune destruction of β pancreatic cells (islets of <br>Langerhans). Classical treatment is based on insulin therapy to normalize <br>blood glucose levels and prevent acute and chronic complications of type 1 <br>diabetes. Transplantation of human islets began in the 1970s but it was not <br>until 1989 that the first patient was able to stop exogenous insulin. The <br>success rate improved dramatically in 2000 with the “Edmoton Protocol” based <br>on the need to transplant high quality islets in sufficient number and the <br>use of steroid-free immunosuppressive therapy. General admitted criteria for <br>allogenic islet cells transplantation are C-peptide negative type 1 diabetes <br>for more than 5 years with previous kidney transplantation or T1D with poor <br>diabetes control including episodes of severe hypoglycemia, hypoglycemia <br>unawareness, wide swings of blood glucose levels or consistently high HbA1c <br>levels (>8%). Islets isolation: islets are processed from pancreas procured <br>from cadaveric heart-beating donors. The procedure of islets isolation <br>consists in placing the harvested pancreas in a digestion chamber after <br>injection of an enzyme (collagenase or liberase) in the main pancreatic <br>duct. Islets are purified from the obtained preparation by gradient in a <br>cell separator. Islets are then cultured in adapted solution. All the <br>processing is done under sterile conditions. To be suitable for <br>transplantation, the islet preparation isolated from a donor must contain <br>more than 250,000 islet equivalents and viability up to 80%. The goal is to <br>infuse 10,000 islets equivalent/kg of body mass of the recipient, though it <br>is frequently necessary to perform one or two subsequent grafts. Procedure <br>of transplantation: the transplantation of islets is performed in a <br>heterotopic location in the liver via the portal vein. The access to the <br>portal vein is obtained by either trans-hepatic venous catheterization or <br>through a mesenteric vein during a minilaparotomy. The percutaneous <br>image-guided trans-hepatic route is mainly used. This procedure can be done <br>under local anesthesia and conscious sedation. An intra-hepatic portal <br>branch is punctured generally in the right lobe of the liver. Ultrasonic <br>guidance allows succeeding and securing the puncture. The remaining <br>procedure is performed under fluoroscopic control. A guide wire is placed <br>through the needle in the portal vein and a 4 to 6 French catheter is then <br>pushed up to the portal trunk. Prior to islets infusion, an angiogram is <br>performed to check the position of the catheter, the distribution and the <br>patency of the portal tree. The pancreatic islets (size about 150 ?m) <br>suspended in albumin solution are infused by gravity, along with heparin to <br>embolize in the whole liver parenchyma. Portal pressure monitoring shows <br>usually a slight elevation during infusion of cells. At the end of the <br>delivery, as the catheter is withdrawn, the transhepatic tract is usually <br>occluded by embolic agent. A prophylactic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> is continued for <br>several days to reduce the likelihood of an instant blood mediated <br>inflammatory reaction. Exogenous insulin is given in the early post <br>transplant period to prevent islet damage caused by hyperglycemia. The <br>majority of serious adverse events related to the infusion procedure consist <br>in bleeding complications mainly (13% of procedures) and portal vein <br>thrombosis more rarely (4% partial or complete). The use of heparin has been <br>shown to limit the incidence of thrombosis but to increase the rate of <br>procedural bleeding. Sealing intra-hepatic tract has demonstrated a <br>reduction of the incidence of post-procedural bleeding. The most frequently <br>administered immunosuppressive protocol uses Sirolimus and Tacrolimus in <br>combination as maintenance therapy and one or more induction agents (i.e., <br>anti IL-2 receptor) at the time of the first islet infusion. Results: the <br>report published by the Collaborative Islet Transplant Registry (CITR) in <br>2008 about 325 recipients of 624 islet infusions shows at three years 23% <br>insulin independence, 29% insulin dependence with detectable C-peptide, 26% <br>loss of graft function and 22% missing data. Severe hypoglycemic events <br>decrease dramatically from 85% of patients before transplantation to less <br>than 5% in the first year. High numbers of infusion, greater number of islet <br>equivalents infused, lower pre-transplant HbA1c, processing center related <br>to the transplant center and larger islet size are factors that favor the <br>primary outcomes. In our Swiss-French multicenter study GRAGIL 2 concerning <br>18 T1D patients with poor glucose control (34 infusions), we report <br>significant decrease of HbA1c levels (≤7%) in 67% of recipients, decrease of <br>insulin requirement ≥30% in 89%, C-peptide ≥ 0.5ng/ml in 83% and no severe <br>hypoglycemia in 67% at one year after transplantation. Conclusion: <br>transplantation of isolated pancreatic islet has presently become a clinical <br>option to be considered in the treatment of T1D after kidney transplantation <br>or in case of unstable T1D despite optimal insulin therapy.<br><br>RECORD 653<br>The evaluation and management of postnatal thromboses<br>Saxonhouse M.A. Burchfield D.J.<br>Journal of Perinatology (2009) 29:7 (467-478).

Dawoud I.E. Shoma A. Negm A.M. Amer T.A.<br>World Journal of Surgery (2009) 33:8 (1702-1710). Date of Publication: <br>August 2009<br><br>Background: Hypersplenism occurs in patients with chronic liver disease, and <br>splenectomy is the definitive treatment. However, the operation may be <br>hazardous in patients with poor liver function. In recent years, partial <br>splenic embolization (PSE) has been widely used in patients with <br>hypersplenism and cirrhosis. This study was conducted to assess the safety <br>and efficacy of PSE compared to splenectomy in the management of <br>hypersplenism in cirrhotic patients. Methods: This study comprised 40 <br>patients with hypersplenism secondary to cirrhosis. They were divided into <br>two groups, each including 20 patients. The first group of patients were <br>treated by PSE using polyvinyl alcohol particles to achieve embolization of <br>at least 50% of the distal branches of the splenic artery. Postembolization <br>arteriography and computed tomography were performed to document the extent <br>of devascularization. Patients in the second group were treated by <br>splenectomy with or without devascularization and left gastric ligation <br>according to the presence or absence of esophageal varices. Results: There <br>was marked improvement in platelet and leukocytic counts in both groups, and <br>the counts remained at appropriate levels during the follow-up period. All <br>patients in the first group had problems related to postembolization <br>syndrome that abated by the first week. One patient in the first group died <br>from myocardial infarction. No deaths occurred in the second group. <br>Asymptomatic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> developed in one patient in the first <br>group that was treated with <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, and another patient developed <br>splenic abscess treated by splenectomy with a good outcome. In the second <br>group, three patients developed <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>, one of them being <br>readmitted 4 months postoperatively with mesenteric vascular occlusion; that <br>patient underwent a resection anastomosis with good outcome. Conclusions: <br>Partial splenic embolization is an effective therapeutic modality for the <br>treatment of hypersplenism secondary to chronic liver disease. It is a <br>simple, rapid procedure that is easily performed under local anesthesia; and <br>it allows preservation of adequate splenic tissue to safeguard against <br>overwhelming infection. © 2009 Société Internationale de Chirurgie.<br><br>RECORD 658<br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> management in candidates for liver transplantation <br>(LT)<br>Sartori M.T.

Date of Publication: July <br>2009<br><br>Background: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> is an important complication after <br>pediatric liver transplantation and occurs at anytime following the <br>operation. Early post-operatively, it can lead to graft dysfunction, <br>especially in patients receiving large grafts (GRWR>4%). Later, patients can <br>develop thrombocytopenia, ascites, splenomegaly, upper GI bleeding, and <br>other clinical manifestations. Aim: To describe a combined technique to <br>reestablish portal flow in cases of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>/stenosis after <br>the transplant. Methods: 1% (4 patients) of 367 children submitted to liver <br>transplantation from Jun/1991 to Dec/2008 underwent portal vein <br>recanalization through a combined approach, (transhepatic + laparotomy). All <br>patients had biliary atresia with a median body weight of 6.9kg (range <br>5.3-10.4Kg) at the time of transplantation. They developed portal vein <br>thrombosis (n=3) and stenosis (n=1). The laparotomy was used to give the <br>intervention radiology team a tributary of the superior mesenteric vein in <br>order to guide the portal vein dilatation and stenting. All patients <br>received a left lateral segment (3 LDLT, 1 SPLIT), with a median GRWR=3.3% <br>(range 2.5-6%). These patients presented with ascites, splenomegaly, <br>thrombocytopenia, and GI bleeding 1.3 to 40 months after the transplant. At <br>the time of the procedure, these patients median age and body weight were 28 <br>months (range 8-43 mo) and 13.2Kg (range 5.5-20.9Kg), respectively. Results: <br>Three patients underwent a successful balloon dilatation and stenting with <br>the combined technique. One patient had an extensive thrombosis of the <br>portomesenteric venous system and the guidewire could not be advanced to the <br>emergence of the portal vein.

Introduction: <br>With advances in CT-imaging, an increasing number of 'incidental' venous <br>thromboembolism is being diagnosed. Among these we find a subset with <br>incidental splanchnic thromboembolism (SVT). The natural history, morbidity <br>and mortality of this phenomenon is largely unknown. This is a descriptive <br>retrospective review of cancer patients with incidental diagnosis of SVT <br>identified on routine CT. Method: A search of the radiology database at <br>Castle Hill Hospital was used to identify oncology patients with incidental <br>SVT over a 24 months period using the keywords emboli, embolus, and <br>thrombus. Information on patient demographics, malignancy, treatment and <br>progress was recorded from review of the clinical notes. Results: Fourteen <br>patients (8 males, 6 females) with incidental SVT were identified. The <br>prevalence of pancreatic cancer was 50% (7), colorectal cancer 29% (4), <br>gallbladder cancer, neuroendocrine small bowel cancer and retroperitoneal <br>leiosarcoma 7% (1) each. Eight had portal vein thrombus (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>), five superior <br>mesenteric vein thrombus (SMVT) and one hepatic vein thrombus (HVT). One <br>developed SVT while on treament for a previous pulmonary embolus (PE), four <br>had concurrent thrombus in other branches of the splanchnic circulation and <br>two had further thromboses (deep vein thrombosis, and PE). Eight patients <br>were treated with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), 2 with warfarin, 1 <br>had an inferior vena cava filter. Data on <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was unavailable <br>for 3 patients. Previous diagnostic/follow-up CT scans free of thromboses <br>were found for 12 patients. Mean time to SVT event 4.8 months. Nine patients <br>have died and mean survival from the SVT event was 4 months.Conclusion: This <br>series is the first to our knowledge to demonstrate a natural history of <br>this condition in cancer patients.

Date of Publication: July 2009<br><br>Background: Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) is a severe complication of <br>essential thrombocythemia (ET). No clear explanation has been given for the <br>occurrence of thrombosis in this unusual site in patients with ET, but the <br>existence of a specific association between unexplained SVT and the JAK2 <br>mutation has been reported. Methods and Results: The present study describes <br>SVT (portal and splenic vein thrombosis) in a young woman as the first <br>presenting symptom of latent ET. Extensive screening for thrombophilia was <br>negative. Our patient in fact did not fulfill the WHO diagnostic criteria <br>for myeloproliferative disease (MPD), while she had splenomegaly and <br>developed features suggestive of latent ET during follow-up. Conclusions: In <br>these patients with SVT, the detection of JAK2(V617F) mutation is diagnostic <br>for masked MPD as could be documented by bone marrow histopathology. The <br>presence of JAK2(V617F) mutation should be considered per se a prothrombotic <br>state for cerebral, coronary and peripheral microvascular disturbances and <br>for SVT but not for deep vein thrombosis. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> is the treatment <br>of choice for all SVT and proper treatment of the MPD is recommended in <br>patients with SVT associated with the JAK2(V617F) mutation.

Date of <br>Publication: Jul 2009<br><br>BACKGROUND: Although portal and/or splenic vein thrombosis after partial <br>splenic embolization (PSE) is a well-known complication, few reports <br>evaluating risk factors have been published. PURPOSE: To investigate risk <br>factors and clinical course of portal and/or splenic vein thrombosis after <br>PSE. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with severe hypersplenism <br>underwent PSE between March 2005 and April 2008. The correlation between <br>portal and/or splenic vein thrombosis after PSE detected on multidetector <br>row CT (MDCT) and various factors were retrospectively reviewed. Further, <br>the clinical course of portal and/or splenic vein thrombosis after PSE was <br>observed on follow-up MDCT. RESULTS: Splenic vein thrombosis was detected in <br>eight patients (50%) on MDCT images taken within 9 days after PSE. In one, <br>the thrombosis also involved the portal vein. The infarct volume was <br>identified as a significant risk factor for portal and/or splenic vein <br>thrombosis (P=0.046). In all but one patient, splenic vein thrombosis <br>resolved completely or improved without <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy. In this <br>patient, both portal and splenic vein thrombosis developed after PSE, and <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy was necessary. CONCLUSION: It is suggested that a <br>large splenic infarct volume is a risk factor for portal and/or splenic vein <br>thrombosis after PSE.

Methods: A total of 6 patients with acute extensive PV-SMV <br>thrombosis after splenectomy were treated by transjugular approach <br>catheter-directed thrombolysis. The mean age of the patients was 41.2 years. <br>After access to the portal system via the transjugular approach, pigtail <br>catheter fragmentation of clots, local urokinase injection, and manual <br>aspiration thrombectomy were used for the initial treatment of PV-SMV <br>thrombosis, followed by continuous thrombolytic therapy via an indwelling <br>infusion catheter in the SMV, which was performed for three to six days. <br>Adequate <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was given during treatment, throughout <br>hospitalization, and after discharge. Results: Technical success was <br>achieved in all 6 patients. Clinical improvement was seen in these patients <br>within 12-24 h of the procedure. No complications were observed. The 6 <br>patients were discharged 6-14 d (8 ± 2.5 d) after admission. The mean <br>duration of follow-up after hospital discharge was 40 ± 16.5 mo. Ultrasound <br>and contrast-enhanced computed tomography confirmed patency of the PV and <br>SMV, and no recurrent episodes of PV-SMV thrombosis developed during the <br>follow-up period. Conclusion: Catheter-directed thrombolysis via <br>transjugular intrahepatic access is a safe and effective therapy for the <br>management of patients with symptomatic acute extensive PV-SMV thrombosis. © <br>2009 The WJG Press and Baishideng.

The patient refused surgical resection <br>and he was treated with phenoxybenzamine, an α-receptor blocker. In <br>addition, the patient sought relief with alternative medicine. As fatigue <br>progressed and jaundice occurred, he was seen by a general practitioner. The <br>patient was normotensive and laboratory testing showed normal creatinine <br>levels (64 μmol/L) and liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, 25 U/L; <br>alanine aminotransferase, 14 U/L). Two weeks later, the patient became <br>confused and somnolent and he was brought to a local hospital. The initial <br>blood pressure was 151/110 mm Hg. Examination revealed acute renal and liver <br>failure. Echocardiography showed a severely depressed left ventricular <br>ejection fraction (LVEF) of less than 20%. Antihypertensive treatment with <br>labetalol was started and the patient was transferred to our tertiary <br>intensive care unit. The somnolent patient presented with clammy skin and <br>severe peripheral cyanosis. He was afebrile. Blood pressure values were <br>normal at that time, despite grossly elevated norepinephrine levels of 70 <br>times the upper limits of normal. Intubation for airway protection was <br>performed. Laboratory testing was remarkable for high liver enzymes and <br>creatinine values, coagulation abnormalities, and elevated lactate levels <br>(Table 1). The patient was anuric, and severely impaired kidney perfusion <br>was seen by ultrasound. A computed tomographic scan confirmed a large <br>abdominal tumor with central necrosis (Fig. 1). A portal vein thrombus with <br>ischemia of extended parts of the right liver lobe was detected (Fig. 2). <br>Labetalol was stopped and replaced by IV phentolamine, a pure α-blocker. <br>Continuous renal replacement therapy was initiated. With normalization of <br>the peripheral circulation, cardiac index increased substantially and <br>lactate normalized. After 12 hours of treatment, echocardiography showed an <br>improvement of the LVEF to 37%. As liver function ameliorated, <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was initiated for the <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. Four days <br>later, the patient was extubated and oral medication begun. Efficient blood <br>pressure control was achieved by doxazosine (10 mg BID), carvedilol (25 mg <br>BID), lisinopril (30 mg OD), and nifedipine (60 mg OD). After 15 days in the <br>intensive care unit and 22 days on the ward, the patient was discharged. Six <br>weeks after the initial admission, he was scheduled for surgery. <br>Preoperatively, an (18)F-DOPA-PET scan did not show metastasis, and an <br>embolization of the lesion was performed. The tumor was removed, and <br>histology confirmed the diagnosis of a pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma. <br>Postoperatively, LVEF recovered to more than 50% and the antihypertensive <br>medication could be stopped, while the patient still required intermittent <br>hemodialysis. Pheochromocytomas are rare tumors, occurring in 0.05% of the <br>population [1]. They are the cause of secondary hypertension in less than 1% <br>[2]. About 25% of the tumors are associated with genetic disorders [3]. <br>Although our patients' family history was negative, the presentation in <br>childhood (classic pheochromocytoma) and the extraadrenal manifestation 40 <br>years later would be consistent with a germline mutation in the gene <br>encoding the B subunit of mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) [3]. <br>However, genetic testing was negative (Table 2). Pheochromocytoma <br>classically presents with recurrent headache, sweating, and tachycardia [4]. <br>However, it can present with a wide variety of symptoms including shock [3]. <br>Our case is not only remarkable for its initial presentation and recurrence <br>4 decades later but also for its most recent presentation with portal vein <br>thrombosis. We hypothesize that low blood flow as a result of the impaired <br>LV function as well as volume depletion secondary to vasoconstriction led to <br>this complication. Case reports of venous thromboses in pheochromocytoma <br>exist. However, they are associated with tumor invasion into blood vessels <br>[5,6]. Paraneoplastic thrombophilia is uncommon in pheochromoytomas. <br>Ischemia of parts of the right liver lobe with subsequent liver failure is <br>explained by interruption of the dual blood supply: the thrombus obstructed <br>venous inflow whereas vasoconstriction impaired arterial liver perfusion. <br>Liver function recovered remarkable quickly after restoration of arterial <br>perfusion. Low cardiac output was caused by several consequences of the <br>massive catecholamine release [7]. First, a persistent overstimulation with <br>epinephrine leads to down-regulation of cardiac β(1) receptors [8,9] and to <br>a switch from β(1) to β(2) signaling, resulting in negative inotropy [10]. <br>Second, vasoconstriction increased afterload, which further impaired LV <br>function. Finally, tachycardia can impair diastolic ventricular filling. The <br>case highlights that pheochromocytoma can induce multiple organ failure. <br>Liver infarction developed because venous inflow was obstructed by a portal <br>vein thrombus and arterial perfusion was severely impaired due to <br>vasoconstriction. Effective α-blocking treatment improved the macro- and <br>microcirculation resulting in an improvement of organ dysfunction in general <br>and liver failure in particular. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Yersiz H. Hiatt J.R. Busuttil <br>R.W.<br>Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2009) 208:5 (896-903). Date of <br>Publication: May 2009<br><br>Background: Thromboses of the hepatic artery (HAT) and portal vein (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) may <br>complicate orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) and result in graft loss <br>and mortality. Revision and retransplantation are treatment options, but <br>their longterm outcomes remain undefined. This study was undertaken to <br>evaluate the incidence of major vascular complications after OLT, determine <br>efficacy of therapies, and identify factors influencing longterm outcomes. <br>Study Design: All patients undergoing OLT from 1984 to 2007 were evaluated. <br>Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to define the effects of vascular <br>complications on posttransplant survival. Anastomotic revision and arterial <br>thrombolysis were compared with retransplantation as treatment for HAT. <br>After 2002, porta hepatis dissection was initiated with early occlusion of <br>common hepatic artery (CHA) inflow; its impact on HAT incidence was <br>determined. Results: From 1984 to 2007, 4,234 OLTs were performed. HAT <br>occurred in 203 patients (5%) and <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in 84 (2%). Graft survival was <br>significantly reduced by HAT or <span style="color: red">PVT</span>; patient survival was reduced only by <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Retransplantation for HAT improved patient survival over revision or <br>thrombolysis in the first year but did not provide longterm survival <br>advantage (56% versus 56% at 5 years; p = 0.53). Patients with HAT had only <br>10% graft salvage with anastomotic revision or thrombolysis. HAT was <br>significantly reduced with early CHA inflow occlusion (1.1% versus 3.7%; p = <br>0.002). Factors increasing risk of HAT included pediatric recipients, liver <br>cancer, and aberrant arterial anatomy requiring complex reconstruction. <br>Conclusions: Both HAT and <span style="color: red">PVT</span> significantly reduce graft survival after OLT; <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span> more adversely affects patient survival. Revision and thrombolysis <br>rarely salvage grafts after HAT; retransplantation provides superior <br>short-term, but not longterm, survival. Avoidance of vascular complications <br>in OLT is critical, especially with today's scarcity of donor livers.

Ulrich B. Thomas B. Stephan S.<br>Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2009) 48 SUPPL. 3 <br>(E118). Date of Publication: May 2009<br><br>Background and Aim: Selective angiography is the gold standard for detailed <br>evaluation of vascular structures. Modern catheter technology enables <br>endovascular interventions during the same procedure. We present our <br>preliminary experience in pre- and postoperative diagnostic as well as <br>therapeutic catheterizations of the portal vein circulation. Methods: Direct <br>portal vein catheterizations were performed percutaneously in general <br>anaesthesia using the transhepatic or transsplenic approach, respectively, <br>with ultrasound as well as fluoroscopic guidance. The track in the spleen <br>left by the sheath was closed with coils in all but one patient, we only <br>used coils after transhepatic catheterization once. Results: Between 2006 <br>and 2008, 17 direct portal vein angiographies were performed in 11 patients <br>[age: 2-16 years, body weight: 12-68 kg]. Transsplenic direct selective <br>angiography (n = 8) of the extrahepatic portal vein was predominantly used <br>to display splenic and mesenteric veins as well as the extent and the <br>distribution of collateral vessels in patients with <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> <br>to define surgical [shunt procedure vs liver transplantation] or <br>endovascular [recanalization and embolization of collateral vessels, <br>respectively] options. Transsplenic stent angioplasty of portal vein <br>stenosis and transsplenic recanalization of complete <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> <br>was successfully performed in one patient each. Transhepatic catheterization <br>of the portal vein was chosen for balloon (n = 2) or stent angioplasty (n = <br>5) of portal vein stenosis after liver transplantation. In general, these <br>are time-consuming procedures requiring sophisticated equipment and <br>experienced investigators. Most patients needed multiple punctures, before a <br>wire could be advanced into the portal vein. In 3 patients we were not able <br>to enter the portal vein percutaneously by the transhepatic (n = 2) or the <br>transsplenic route, respectively. All 3 were catheterized successfully <br>during a second procedure using transsplenic access. We faced an oozing <br>bleeding into the abdominal cavity along the sheath requiring blood <br>transfusion in one patient. A thrombus without compromise of blood flow was <br>noticed after stent angioplasty of portal vein stenosis which resolved <br>during <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy. Transitory mild fever and moderate abdominal <br>pain within 48 h after intervention occurred in 60% of patients. Fever with <br>positive blood culture was noticed in one patient after transhepatic stent <br>angioplasty of portal vein stenosis. Conclusions: Direct selective portal <br>vein angiography is a technically demanding procedure. It uniquely displays <br>the extrahepatic portal venous system including collateral vessels and gives <br>haemodynamic data that may help to take therapeutic decisions. Endovascular <br>catheter interventions may successfully be performed using the transhepatic <br>or transsplenic approach.<br><br>RECORD 670<br>Pylephlebitis due to perforated appendicitis in a teenager<br>Levin C.

METHODS: Between May <br>1995 and September 2007, 194 orthotopic liver transplantations were <br>performed, of which 24 cases presented <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. There were 12 <br>patients with grade I, 9 with grade II, 2 with grade III and 1 with grade <br>IV. The management of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> depended mainly on its extent. Ligation of the <br>collateral circulation, especially spontaneous or surgical splenorenal <br>shunt, was made as approaches to improve portal flow.Heparin or <br>low-molecule-weight heparin as a prophylactic <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy was <br>maintained during and after operation if prothrombin time is less than <br>eighteen seconds.

Date of Publication: <br>April 2009<br><br>Aims: Obliterative portal venopathy (OPV) is a rare condition characterized <br>by a primary occlusion of intrahepatic portal vein branches. Clinical <br>features, course, and causes remain unclear. The aim of this work was to <br>clarify the clinical and histological presentations, the associated diseases <br>and the outcome of patients in whom a diagnosis of OPV was made at biopsy. <br>Methods: A retrospective study of 59 patients diagnosed with OPV between <br>1987 to 2008, in a single hospital. Diagnosis was established when, in a <br>liver biopsy sample (>1 cm in length and containing >5 portal tracts), >60% <br>of portal venules were obstructed, in the absence of cirrhosis. Results: Age <br>at diagnosis was 7-77 yr. Median follow-up was 8 years (±7 years). Diagnosis <br>required repeated histologies in 24 (41%) patients: OPV was combined with <br>regenerative hepatocellular changes (71%), sinusoidal fibrosis (57%), <br>sinusoidal dilatation (41%), and aberrant vessels (35%); septal fibrosis <br>(Hepatoportal sclerosis 29%). Prothrombotic and/or systemic diseases were <br>associated with OPV in only 48% of patients. 19% of patients had severe <br>complications, leading to transplantation or death at a median age of 47.5 <br>yrs.

He was still receiving a <br>combined antibiotic regimen against pulmonary tuberculosis which was <br>diagnosed eight months ago. Results: Two dimensional colored Doppler <br>echocardiography revealed diffuse pericardial calcification and fresh <br>thrombus within dilated hepatic veins.

Date of Publication: 2009<br><br>Background: Portal hypertension and intestinal infarction are potentially <br>lethal complications of acute <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Recent venous thrombi may be <br>hyperattenuated on unenhanced CT scans, caused by high protein content of <br>concentrated blood clots. Early accurate diagnosis of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is increasingly <br>important for specific anticoagulant treatment. Aim: To determine the <br>frequency of hyperattenuation within the portal vein on unenhanced CT scans <br>in patients with proved acute <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. Patients and Methods: <br>Twenty six patients with acute <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> or its main <br>tributaries were included over a four-year period. All patients had <br>unenhanced and contrast-enhanced CT scan at diagnosis. CT scans were <br>retrospectively analyzed by two expert radiologists on PACS. Attenuation <br>characteristics of the portal vein and its main tributaries were assessed on <br>unenhanced CT scans. <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> was diagnosed by the presence of <br>low-attenuation intra-luminal filling defect, on portal venous phase. <br>Results: 26 patients (16 men, median age 46.6 years, 25-84 years) with acute <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span> were included. Clinical symptoms at onset were abdominal pain in 25/26 <br>(96%), and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in 13/26 (50%) of <br>patients Inherited thrombophilia was present in 6/26 patients, acquired <br>thrombophilia in12/26, oral contraceptive use in 5/10, while 9/26 had a <br>local factor. Morphological changes of the liver, splenomegaly, ischemic <br>bowel signs and radiological ascites were present respectively in 8, 13, 4 <br>and 6/26 patients At diagnosis, 6/26 patients had isolated portal vein <br>thrombosis, and 20/26 had associated mesenteric and splenic vein thrombosis. <br>Hyperattenuation within the portal vein and/or its main tributaries on <br>unenhanced CT was found in 21/26 (81%) patients (5 portal vein alone, 6 main <br>tributaries alone, 10 portal vein and tributaries). Median time between <br>onset of symptoms and CT was 5 days (range: 1-60). Hyperattenuation was seen <br>in 15/16, (93%), in6/8 (75%) and in0/2 (0%) patients when CT was performed <br>within 0-7, 7-30 or 30-60 days from onset of symptoms respectively. <br>Conclusion: Hyperattenuation within the portal vein or its main tributaries <br>on unenhanced CT is frequent in acute <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>.

Date of Publication: 2009<br><br>Background: In patients with non-malignant non-cirrhotic portal vein <br>thrombosis (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>), myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) are the most frequent <br>underlying cause, occurring in approximately one third of the cases. The aim <br>of this study was to describe the long-term outcome of this specific patient <br>group. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed including all <br>patients referred to our hospital between January 1980 and December 2008 <br>with non-malignant non-cirrhotic <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and confirmed MPD. Results: We included <br>47 patients (72% female) with a median age at diagnosis of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> of 47 years <br>(range 11-79).

Type of <br>MPD was defined as polycythemia vera (n=14), essential thrombocytosis <br>(n=12), myelofibrosis (n=6) or unclassified MPD (n=15). The JAK2 V617F <br>mutation was present in 28 of 30 tested patients. Additional prothrombotic <br>factors were present in 32% of the cases (n=15).

Treatment for MPD was given in 39 <br>patients (83%), most frequently consisting of acetylsalicylic acid, <br>hydroxyurea and/or phlebotomy. During follow-up 31 patients (66%) developed <br>esophageal varices, of whom 18 (38%) experienced at least one bleeding <br>episode. The occurrence of variceal bleeding was not significantly related <br>to long-term use of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> (p=0.26). In 12 patients (26%) at least <br>one additional thrombotic event occurred, of whom 3 were using <br>anticoagulants at the time of first new event. In 3 patients recurrent <br>thrombosis developed after previous <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> had been discontinued. <br>Eighteen patients (38%) died during followup at a median age of 64.4 years <br>(range 30-88). Overall survival rate was 97% and 88% at 1 and 5 years, <br>respectively. In 11 cases (61%) death was directly related to a new <br>thrombotic event (cerebral infarction (n=2) or mesenteric vein thrombosis <br>(n=1)) or end-stage MPD (end-stage myelofibrosis (n=5) or acute myeloid <br>leukemia (n=3)). One patient died due to variceal bleeding. Conclusions: <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>is often the presenting symptom of an underlying MPD, highlighting the <br>necessity for extensive screening. Treatment with <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was not <br>associated with an increased risk of variceal bleeding during follow-up. <br>Recurrent thrombosis is a frequent complication in patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and <br>MPD.

Methods: Multicentric retrospective analyses of 20 patients <br>with HIV and OPV seen in 2003 and 2009. Results: 20 patients (12 males), <br>median age 51 years (range 32-69), median CD4 227/mm3 (100-355), median HIV <br>viral load 25 copies/mL (0-26000) were followedup for 3-69 months (median 14 <br>months) after histological diagnosis of OPV. Liver biopsy showed associated <br>nodular regenerative hyperplasia in 13 patients. OPV was diagnosed 4-19 <br>years (median 13 years) after HIV infection diagnosis. Identified <br>prothrombotic factors were protein S deficiency in 10 patients, protein C <br>deficiency in 1 and antiphospholipid syndrome in 1. All patients had <br>received didanoside for a median duration of 120 months (48-1156). At <br>diagnosis, median AST level was 55 IU (32-131). Oesophageal varices and <br>splenomegaly were present in 16/20 and 13/20 patients respectively. Median <br>platelets count was 132 ×109/L (58-226). During follow up, among 17 patients <br>with oesophageal varices, 9 had variceal bleeding, 2 had bleeding recurrence <br>despite beta blockers. Severe related bleeding complications were: ascites <br>in 5 patients responsible for severe undernutrition in 3, ascites infection <br>in 2; and liver related death in 2. One patient with refractory hydrothorax <br>had liver transplantation with a good outcome. Eleven patients had <br>thrombosis of the portal vein or its branches, extending to the mesenteric <br>vein in 1 patient. In 4 of these 11 patients, <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> <br>occurred during follow-up. All these 11 patients were subsequently given <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy. Recanalization rate was 40% at one year. Two <br>patients had extension of thrombosis despite <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> with Warfarin. <br>One year transplantfree and overall survival rates were 81% and 86%, <br>respectively. Ascites and lower body mass index were significantly <br>associated to an unfavourable outcome (transplantation or death). <br>Conclusion: OPV is a potentially fatal disease occurring late in HIV <br>infection course.

Date of Publication: March <br>2009<br><br>The management of splanchnic venous thrombosis, extra-hepatic portal vein <br>obstruction and the Budd-Chiari syndrome has been transformed in the last <br>ten years. The diagnostic methods are less invasive due to advances in <br>imaging techniques. Myeloproliferatve disease, observed in 20 to 50% of <br>cases, may be identified by the JAK2 V817B mutation. Therapeutic strategies <br>are planned by stages according to response to previous treatment. The <br>common findings of a prothrombotic state such as myeloproliferative <br>syndromes, deficits in protein S and C, mutation of factor V Leiden or <br>factor II and the antiphospholipid syndrome, require complete investigation <br>including the search for systemic diseases or more rare associated <br>aetiologies. Doppler ultrasonography should be performed by a trained <br>operator informed of the suspected diagnosis so that the obstruction and/or <br>collateral circulation can be documented. The presenting signs of acute <br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> are epigastric pain in 80% of cases, associated with <br>a marked inflammatory syndrome.When the diagnosis is missed, portal <br>cavernoma may develop.

Date of Publication: 2009<br><br>Background: The exact incidence and prevalence of Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) <br>is unknown in the general population. Published reports differ in terms of <br>the clinical characteristics, effects of therapy and survival. Aims: To <br>investigate the epidemiology, clinical presentation and survival in patients <br>with BCS. Methods: Retrospective multicentre studyin Sweden reviewing the <br>medical records of all patients with BCS 1986-2003, identified from the <br>computerised diagnosis database of 11 hospitals, including all university <br>hospitals and liver transplantation centres. Results: Forty-three patients <br>with BCS were identified, of whom nine (21%) had concomitant portal vein <br>thrombosis. The mean age-standardised incidence and prevalence rates in <br>1990-2001 were calculated to be 0.8 per million per year and 1.4 per million <br>inhabitants respectively. Myeloproliferative disorders (38%), thrombophilic <br>factors (31%) and oral contraceptives (30%) were common aetiological <br>factors. Two or more risk factors were present in 44%. In 23%, no risk <br>factor was evident. The median follow-up time was 2.7 years. Seventy-two <br>percent were on anticoagulant therapy during follow-up. Transjugular <br>intrahepatic portosystemic shunting, surgical shunting procedures and liver <br>transplantation were performed in 4, 6 and 18 patients respectively. <br>Nineteen patients died. The overall transplantation-free survival at 1, 5 <br>and 10 years was 47, 28 and 17% respectively. Conclusions: Budd-Chiari <br>syndrome is a rare disorder; the mean age-standardised incidence and <br>prevalence rates in Sweden in 1990-2001 were calculated to be 0.8 per <br>million per year and 1.4 per million inhabitants respectively.

Methods: Thirty-eight patients diagnosed with A<span style="color: red">PVT</span> between <br>1995 and 2003 from 5 Spanish referral hospitals, in whom cirrhosis and <br>malignancy were specifically excluded, were included in this retrospective <br>study. The response to <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy and development of portal <br>hypertension-related complications during follow-up were evaluated. Results: <br>Mean follow-up was 43 months (range, 6-112 months).

Methods: Twenty-one cases <br>derived from several geographical centers (Brazil, Serbia, Italy, Israel, <br>United Kingdom, and South Africa) are presented. The major clinical, <br>serological, and histopathological data (where available) of this cohort are <br>described, documented, and analyzed. Results: Patients were suffering mainly <br>from systemic lupus erythematosus (9 patients) or primary APS (8 patients). <br>Peripheral vascular occlusions occurred during the course of the <br>catastrophic APS in 5 patients. The vascular occlusions occurred both early <br>and very late in the course of the disease (time after APS diagnosis, 0-38 <br>years). Vasculitis was present in 7 patients and 5 demonstrated the typical <br>antiphospholipid antibody (aPL)-vasculopathy with complicating bland <br>thrombosis. Myocardial infarctions had occurred in 4 patients but it was not <br>possible to determine whether they suffered from premature atherosclerotic <br>disease or whether the infarctions were aPL-related. The appearance of <br>livedo reticularis preceding the arterial thrombosis was noted in 9 <br>patients. Cryoglobulinemia was detected in only 1 patient. Conclusions: <br>Peripheral vascular disease leading to amputation of digits or limbs is a <br>severe complication encountered in patients with APS.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the feasibility <br>of band ligation in primary and secondary prevention of GEVB in <br>anticoagulated patients. Five patients (age 60.2±7.3 SD years: 3 males, 2 <br>females) with esophageal varices on <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> were studied using a <br>retrospective chart review in a tertiary hospital setting.

Two patients had experienced prior acute GEVB; band <br>ligation performed during acute bleeding was not included in the study. All <br>patients had at least grade III-IV esophageal varices on outpatient <br>follow-up for band ligation. Three bands were placed/patient and study <br>patients underwent 3 banding sessions on an average. None of the patients <br>developed GEVB after band ligation.

Methods: A total of 75 <br>patients (40 female, 35 male) who were diagnosed between January 2002 and <br>July 2004 as having BCS were studied prospectively. Findings from on <br>physical examination, ultrasonography, duplex ultrasonography and venography <br>were analyzed.

Hennion D.R.<br>Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2008) 21:3 (237-243). Date <br>of Publication: May/June 2008<br><br>Background: Abdominal pain is a common primary care complaint. Portal vein <br>thrombosis (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is a rare cause of abdominal pain, typically associated <br>with cirrhosis or thrombophilia. The following describes the presentation of <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span> in a young male, the search for risk factors and underlying etiology, <br>and the debate of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy. Case: A 28-year-old male <br>presented with periumbilical pain, post-prandial nausea, and sporadic <br>hematemesis for 3 weeks. The diagnosis was confirmed with a triphasic liver <br>computerized tomography after obtaining an abnormal right upper quadrant <br>ultrasound. This unexpected finding prompted investigation for intrinsic <br>hepatic disease and potential hypercoagulable disorders. Laboratory analysis <br>revealed a heterozygous genotype for the prothrombin 20210G/A mutation, an <br>identified risk factor for venous thrombosis. Discussion: Recommendations <br>concerning <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> for <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in the absence of cirrhosis are not <br>clearly defined. Current literature describes the following factors as <br>indications for <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>: acute thrombus, lack of cavernous <br>transformation, absence of esophageal varices, and mesenteric venous <br>thrombosis. This patient had clinical indications both for and against <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. Weighing this individual's clinical circumstances, we <br>concluded the risk of thrombus in the setting of a hypercoagulable disorder <br>outweighed the risk of variceal bleeding. A minimum of 6 months of <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> was initiated. Conclusion: <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is an uncommon cause of <br>abdominal pain, and the absence of hepatic disease should raise the index of <br>suspicion for an underlying thrombophilia.

Date of Publication: April 2008<br><br>INTRODUCTION: Laparoscopic splenectomy has become the surgical procedure of <br>choice for various diseases of the spleen. <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) <br>after splenectomy occurs in 0.5% to 22% of patients. Symptoms are <br>nonspecific and include fever, abdominal pain, and epigastric distress. Risk <br>factors for <span style="color: red">PVT</span> after splenectomy include underlying hematologic disorders, <br>massive splenectomy, and other hypercoagulable states. METHODS: We describe <br>a case of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in a woman who underwent laparoscopic splenectomy for <br>symptomatic splenomegaly secondary to systemic mastocytosis. The patient was <br>discharged from the hospital without <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> and experienced <br>nonspecific symptoms beginning 10 days postoperatively. Diagnosis of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was <br>made by contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography. The patient had no <br>underlying risk factors. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> treatment facilitated <br>recanalization of the portal vein and this was verified by Doppler <br>ultrasound at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: <span style="color: red">PVT</span> after laparoscopic splenectomy is <br>not uncommon. Signs and symptoms are vague and require a high index of <br>suspicion for timely diagnosis. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> is the treatment of choice <br>and allows recanalization of the portal system in the majority of cases. © <br>2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.<br><br>RECORD 707<br>Thrombosis and <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in liver disease<br>Valla D.C.<br>Hepatology (2008) 47:4 (1384-1393).

All patients with refractory ascites or <br>deteriorating liver function were, depending on morphology of inferior vena <br>cava (IVC) and/or hepatic vein (HV) obstruction, triaged for radiological <br>intervention, in addition to <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy. Asymptomatic patients, <br>patients with diuretic-responsive ascites and stable liver function, and <br>patients unwilling for surgical intervention were treated symptomatically <br>with <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. Results: Mean duration of symptoms was 41.5 ± 11.2 <br>(range = 1-240) mo. HV thrombosis (HVT) was present in 29 (59.1%), IVC <br>thrombosis in eight (16.3%), membranous obstruction of IVC in two (4%) and <br>both IVC-HV thrombosis in 10 (20.4%) cases. Of 35 cases tested for <br>hypercoagulability, 27 (77.1%) were positive for one or more hypercoagulable <br>states. Radiological intervention was technically successful in 37/38 <br>(97.3%): IVC stenting in seven (18.9%), IVC balloon angioplasty in two <br>(5.4%), combined IVC-HV stenting in two (5.4%), HV stenting in 11 (29.7%), <br>transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) in 13 (35.1%) and <br>combined TIPS-IVC stenting in two (5.4%). Complications encountered in <br>follow-up: death in five, re-stenosis of the stent in five (17.1%), hepatic <br>encephalopathy in two and hepatocellular carcinoma in one patient. Of nine <br>patients treated medically, two showed complete resolution of HVT. <br>Conclusion: In our series, HVT was the predominant cause of BCS. In the last <br>five years with the availability of sophisticated tests for <br>hypercoagulability, etiologies were defined in 85.7% of cases.

Aim: To provide an update on recent <br>advances in the aetiology and management of acute and chronic non-cirrhotic <br>non-malignant extrahepatic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. Method: A PubMed search <br>was performed to identify relevant literature using search terms including <br>'<span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>', 'variceal bleeding' and 'portal biliopathy'. <br>Results: Myeloproliferative disease is the most common risk factor in <br>patients with non-cirrhotic non-malignant extrahepatic portal vein <br>thrombosis. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy for at least 3 months is indicated in <br>patients with acute extrahepatic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>. However, in <br>patients with extrahepatic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> due to a prothrombotic <br>disorder, permanent <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy can be considered. The most <br>important complication of extrahepatic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> is <br>oesophagogastric variceal bleeding. Endoscopic treatment is the first-line <br>treatment for variceal bleeding. In several of the patients with <br>extrahepatic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> biliopathy changes on endoscopic <br>retrograde cholangiography (ERCP) have been reported. Dependent on the <br>persistence of the biliary obstruction, treatment can vary from ERCP to <br>hepaticojejunostomy. Conclusion: Prothrombotic disorders are the major <br>causes of non-cirrhotic, non-malignant extrahepatic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> <br>and <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy is warranted in these patients. The prognosis of <br>patients with non-cirrhotic, non-malignant extrahepatic portal vein <br>thrombosis is good, and is not determined by portal hypertension <br>complications but mainly by the underlying cause of thrombosis. © 2007 The <br>Authors.<br><br>RECORD 711<br>Coagulation abnormalities in cirrhotic patients with <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span><br>Amitrano L.

Screening for thrombophilic factors was performed in 104 patients. <br>New thrombotic or bleeding episodes were registered and anticoagulant <br>therapy was performed according to preestablished criteria. RESULTS: SVT was <br>an incidental finding in 34 (28.1%) patients; 34 (28.1%) presented with <br>abdominal infarction; 39 (32.2%) had bowel ischemia or acute portal vein <br>thrombosis; 14 (11.6%) had bleeding from portal hypertensive sources. <br>Survival rates at 1, 3, and 7 yr were 95%, 93.3%, and 89.6%, respectively; <br>87.5% of deaths occurred at onset of SVT as complications of intestinal <br>infarction. Patients with isolated portal vein thromboses had symptoms and <br>intestinal infarction in 16/41 (39%) and 0/41 (0%) of the cases, <br>respectively, whereas superior mesenteric vein thromboses, isolated or not, <br>were associated with symptoms and intestinal infarction in 69/75 (92%) and <br>34/75 (45%), respectively. During the follow-up 14 (14.7%) suffered from 39 <br>episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding with no deaths. A previous <br>gastrointestinal bleed was associated with new hemorrhagic events during <br>follow-up. New venous thrombotic episodes occurred in 10 of 95 patients <br>(10.5%), of which 73% were in the splanchnic area. Seven out of these 10 <br>patients had a chronic myeloproliferative disease (MPD) and none was on <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. CONCLUSIONS: Anticoagulant therapy was effective to obtain <br>recanalization of acute SVT in 45.4% of patients and preserved patients from <br>recurrent thrombosis when given lifelong. © 2007 by Am.

Remzi F.<br>Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2007) 50:10 (1540-1544). Date of <br>Publication: October 2007<br><br>PURPOSE: Portal vein thrombi have been observed after restorative <br>proctocolectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, and present as a clinical <br>spectrum of abdominal pain, fever, and leukocytosis. <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> <br>treatment is usually associated with resolution of symptoms. However, the <br>long-term consequences and effect on pouch function are not known. The <br>purpose of this study was to analyze the long-term functional outcome of <br>patients with confirmed portal vein thrombi after restorative <br>proctocolectomy. METHODS: A retrospective study of all patients undergoing <br>restorative proctocolectomy from January 1997 to 2000 was performed. A <br>case-control study was designed that matched 37 patients with confirmed <br>portal vein thrombi in this period with 133 patients without portal vein <br>thrombi; the groups were compared with respect to pouch function and quality <br>of life by using the Global Cleveland Clinic Quality of Life Questionnaire <br>for pelvic pouch patients. RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 4.73 (range, <br>4.21-7.28) years. The percentage of male patients was 58.8. The most common <br>diagnosis was ulcerative colitis (62.4 percent). There were no significant <br>differences between portal vein thrombi patients and controls with respect <br>to pouch function (number of bowel movements, urgency, incontinence), <br>episodes of pouchitis, or quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Portal vein thrombi <br>can be a serious complication after restorative proctocolectomy that usually <br>resolves with <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy. Long-term pouch function and quality <br>of life are not affected. © 2007 The American Society of Colon and Rectal <br>Surgeons.<br><br>RECORD 717<br>Postoperative complications in patients with <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> after <br>liver transplantation: Evaluation with Doppler ultrasonography<br>Jia Y.-P.

Date of <br>Publication: 14 Sep 2007<br><br>Aim: To study the postoperative complications in patients with preoperative <br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) undergoing liver transplantation (LT) and to <br>evaluate the complications with Doppler ultrasonography. Methods: <br>Petrospective studies were performed on 284 patients undergoing LT (286 LT) <br>with respect to pre- and postoperative clinical data and Doppler <br>ultrasonography. According to the presence and grade of preoperative <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, <br>286 LTs were divided into three groups: complete <span style="color: red">PVT</span> (c-<span style="color: red">PVT</span>), partial <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>(p-<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) and non-<span style="color: red">PVT</span>, with 22, 30 and 234 LTs, respectively. Analyses were <br>carried out to compare the incidence of early postoperative complications. <br>Results: <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis, hepatic artery thrombosis <br>(HAT) and biliary complications were found postoperatively. All <br>complications were detected by routine Doppler ultrasonography and diagnoses <br>made by ultrasound were confirmed by clinical data or/and other imaging <br>studies. Nine out of 286 LTs had postoperative <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. The incidence of the <br>c-<span style="color: red">PVT</span> group was 22.7%, which was higher than that of the p-<span style="color: red">PVT</span> group (3.3%, <br>P < 0.05) and non-<span style="color: red">PVT</span> group (1.3%, P < 0.005). No difference was found <br>between the p-<span style="color: red">PVT</span> and non-<span style="color: red">PVT</span> groups (P > 0.25). Of the 9 cases with <br>postoperative <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, recanalizations were achieved in 7 cases after <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> under the guidance of ultrasound, 1 case received portal <br>vein thrombectomy and 1 case died of acute injection. Ten LTs had <br>postoperative IVC thrombosis. The c-<span style="color: red">PVT</span> group had a higher incidence of IVC <br>thrombosis than the non-<span style="color: red">PVT</span> group (9.1% vs 2.6%, P < 0.05); no significant <br>difference was found between either the c-<span style="color: red">PVT</span> and p-<span style="color: red">PVT</span> groups (9.1% vs <br>6.7%, P > 0.5) or between the p-<span style="color: red">PVT</span> and non-<span style="color: red">PVT</span> groups (P > 0.25). Nine <br>cases with IVC thrombosis were cured by <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> under the guidance <br>of ultrasound, and 1 case gained natural cure without any medical treatment <br>after 2 mo. HAT was found in 2 non-<span style="color: red">PVT</span> cases, giving a rate of 0.7% among <br>286 LTs. Biliary complications were seen in 12 LTs. The incidence of biliary <br>complications in the c-<span style="color: red">PVT</span>, p-<span style="color: red">PVT</span> and non-<span style="color: red">PVT</span> groups was 9.1%, 3.3% and <br>4.3%, respectively (P > 0.25 for all), among which 2 stenosis led <br>retransplantations and others were controlled by relative therapy. <br>Conclusion: C-<span style="color: red">PVT</span> patients tend to have a higher incidence of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and IVC <br>thrombosis than non-<span style="color: red">PVT</span> patients after LT. The incidence of postoperative <br>complications in p-<span style="color: red">PVT</span> patients does not differ from that of non-<span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>patients. A relatively low incidence of HAT was seen in our study.

Gronbaek H.<br>BMC Gastroenterology (2007) 7 Article Number: 34. Date of Publication: 15 <br>Aug 2007<br><br>Background: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is increasingly frequently being <br>diagnosed, but systematic descriptions of the natural history and clinical <br>handling of the condition are sparse. The aim of this retrospective study <br>was to describe risk factors, clinical presentation, complications and <br>treatment of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in a single-centre. Methods: Sixty-seven <br>patients were identified in the electronic records from 1992 to 2005. All <br>data were obtained from the patient records. Results: One or more risk <br>factors (e.g. prothrombotic disorder or abdominal inflammation) were present <br>in 87%. Symptoms were abdominalia, splenomegaly, fever, ascites, <br>haematemesis, and weight loss. Abdominalia and fever occurred more <br>frequently in patients with acute <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Frequent complications were <br>splenomegaly, oesophageal- and gastric varices with or without bleeding, <br>portal hypertensive gastropathy and ascites. Varices and bleeding were more <br>frequent in patients with chronic <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Patients who received anticoagulant <br>therapy more frequently achieved partial/complete recanalization. Patients <br>with varices who were treated endoscopically in combination with β-blockade <br>had regression of the varices. The overall mortality was 13% in one year, <br>and was dependent on underlying causes. Conclusion: Most patients had a <br>combination of local and systemic risk factors for <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. We observed that <br>partial/complete recanalization was more frequent in patients treated with <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy, and that regression of varices was more pronounced <br>in patients who where treated with active endoscopy combined with <br>pharmacological treatment. © 2007 Sogaard et al; licensee BioMed Central <br>Ltd.<br><br>RECORD 719<br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> after laparoscopic splenectomy in benign hematologic <br>diseases<br>Ruiz-Tovar J.

Date of Publication: August 2007<br><br>Introduction: <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> is an unfrequent, but potentially <br>deadly, complication of the laparoscopic splenectomy procedure. The <br>laparoscopic approach has shortened the duration of hospital stay; portal <br>vein thrombosis may appear after the patient has left the hospital, <br>determining a later diagnosis. Because of the mild, nonspecific symptoms, <br>the diagnosis can even be missed and only achieved when chronic <br>complications take place. Objectives: In this study, we aimed to determine <br>the appearance of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in a consecutive series of patients <br>who underwent laparoscopic splenectomy by performing a contrast-enhanced <br>computed tomography (CT) scan postoperatively. Materials and Methods: A <br>transversal study was established, performing in 2005 a contrast-enhanced CT <br>scan on 20 patients who underwent laparoscopic splenectomy between 1999 and <br>2005 at Ramón y Cajal University Hospital (Madrid, Spain). The presence of <br>thrombosis in the splenoportomesenteric axis was investigated. Results: Two <br>(2) cases (10%) of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> were detected: 1 symptomatic case, <br>7 days after surgery, was treated with <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, resulting in the <br>disappearance of the thrombus in a new CT scan 6 months later; the second <br>case was asymptomatic and was discovered during the performance of this <br>study. Conclusions: The contrast-enhanced CT scan shows the best accuracy <br>for the diagnosis of <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>, and it must be performed when <br>any clinical manifestation appear; also, it must still be determined if a <br>contrast-enhanced CT scan should be systematically performed in high-risk <br>thromboembolic patients. An ultrasound Doppler may present many diagnostic <br>errors. It is probably advisable to prolong the antithromboembolic <br>prophylaxis. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.<br><br>RECORD 720<br>Superior mesenteric and <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> in a polycythemia vera <br>patient with JAK2 mutation<br>Araki N.

Acute <span style="color: red">PVT</span> usually presents as abdominal pain. When the <br>thrombus extends to the mesenteric venous arches, intestinal infarction can <br>occur. Chronic <span style="color: red">PVT</span> is usually recognized after a fortuitous diagnosis of <br>hypersplenism or portal hypertension, or when there are biliary symptoms <br>related to portal cholangiopathy. Local risk factors for <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, such as an <br>abdominal inflammatory focus, can be identified in 30% of patients with <br>acute <span style="color: red">PVT</span>; 70% of patients with acute and chronic <span style="color: red">PVT</span> have a general risk <br>factor for <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, most commonly myeloproliferative disease.

Acute cytomegalovirus infection is a rare cause of acquired <br>venous thrombosis in the portal or mesenteric territory, but has never been <br>described extending into a main hepatic vein. Case presentation: A <br>36-year-old immunocompetent woman presented with acute primary <br>cytomegalovirus infection in association with extensive thrombosis in the <br>portal and splenic vein.

We present and discuss an approach <br>to treat BCS complicated by acute <span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Two young female patients presented <br>with acute liver failure, rapidly progressive tense ascites, renal- and <br>respiratory failure. The diagnosis of chronic BCS complicated by acute <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>was confirmed with ultrasound Doppler. Initial treatment was supportive. <br>Right portal vein localization was by transarterial portogram or by computed <br>tomography-guided microcoil placement. Transjugular intrahepatic <br>portosystemic shunt (TIPS) was performed and included Wallstents and a <br>Jograft in one case and Viatorr stentgraft that was extended later with a <br>Hemobahn stentgraft in another. Mechanical clot removal from the portal <br>system was performed in the primary procedure and in a revision procedure in <br>the following few days. Stents were placed precisely with no extension into <br>the inferior vena cava or deeply into the main portal vein. Patients were <br>fully anticoagulated and patency was assessed by ultrasound Doppler. The <br>procedures were performed on days 5 and 10 following admission. In both <br>cases, successful thrombectomies were reveised and maintained. Partial <br>occlusion of the TIPS and reaccumulation of ascites were reversed with <br>repeated procedure. Both patients were discharged without ascites and normal <br>liver function.

Date of Publication: February 2006<br><br>Thrombosis of the portal system is a potentially life-threatening but <br>otherwise underappreciated complication after splenectomy. Nonspecific and <br>mild onset symptoms are the cause of delay in diagnosis, and the short <br>hospital stay after laparoscopic approach could even contribute to the <br>difficulty of early detection of this condition. The aim of this study was <br>to verify if planned imaging controls are able to discover this complication <br>leading to a prompt treatment. Thirty-eight patients (19 males and 19 <br>females with a mean age of 24 years) who underwent laparoscopic splenectomy <br>at our institution were studied to identify clinical signs of thrombosis of <br>the portal venous system and eventually associated factors. All the patients <br>were enrolled in a protocol of imaging surveillance using a doppler <br>ultrasound method. Postoperative thrombosis of the spleno-portal axis <br>occurred in 7 patients (18.9%) of the series. In 3 cases (8.1%) the thrombus <br>extended from the splenic vein to occlude the portal axis. The complication <br>was symptomatic in 4 cases (10.8%), whereas in 3 cases, the thrombosis was <br>an ultrasonographic surprise in totally asymptomatic patients. Thrombosis <br>occurred even as late as 2 months after splenectomy. Splenomegaly was the <br>only significant factor predictive of thrombosis. Only those patients who <br>had an early detection of portal or splenic vein thrombosis had a <br>recanalization of the veins with anticoagulant therapy. Patients with <br>splenomegaly who underwent laparoscopic splenectomy are at risk of <br>thrombosis of the portal system and should undergo strict imaging <br>surveillance and aggressive <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy.

Date of <br>Publication: 20 Jan 2006<br><br>History and admission findings: A 23-year-old woman with a 5-year history of <br>ulcerative colitis was admitted to our hospital because of bloody diarrhea. <br>Two years previously she had undergone a hemicolectomy for a right colonic <br>stricture. A recurrence of inflammatory bowel disease was suspected and <br>treatment with prednisolone begun. The symptoms improved gradually, but 7 <br>days later she complained of lower abdominal pain. Physical examination <br>revealed a soft abdomen, but bowel sounds were reduced. Investigations: The <br>abdominal X-ray was unremarkable, but ultrasonography revealed moderate <br>ascites and no blood flow in the portal vein on Doppler examination. The <br>spleen was slightly enlarged. Contrast-enhanced abdominal magnetic resonance <br>imaging (MRI) was performed immediately, revealing thrombosis of the portal <br>and mesenteric veins. Treatment and course: As there was no suggestion of <br>intestinal necrosis, laparatomy was not considered necessary. Intravenous <br>thrombolytic treatment with urokinase was given continuously (bolus of <br>250000 units, followed by 200 000 units per hour), in order to lower the <br>fibrinogen level to 100 - 150 mg/dl, together with unfractionated heparin, <br>maintaining the activated partial thromboplastin time between 60 and 85 <br>seconds. The thrombolytic treatment had to be stopped several times because <br>of bloody diarrhea, but no transfusion was necessary. Two days after the <br>start of thrombolytic treatment the abdominal pain and ascites ceased. <br>Doppler sonography now demonstrated hepatopetal flow in the previously <br>occluded portal vein. 4 days later, MRI revealed that the thrombus in the <br>portal vein had dissolved and the portal vein was fully patent. The <br>mesenteric vein was partially perfused, a residual thrombus extending into <br>the portal vein. Tests for thrombophilia were negative. The thrombolytic <br>therapy was stopped after 112 hours and the patient was treated with oral <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> for 6 months. The patient recovered completely, with no <br>evidence of portal hypertension during the following 6 months.

METHODS: Patients diagnosed with <br>nonmalignant BCS between 1984 and 2001 were identified in a large <br>international study and classified into isolated BCS (n = 204), BCS-<span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>without spleno-mesenteric vein thrombosis (SMVT; n = 15), and BCS-<span style="color: red">PVT</span> with <br>SMVT (n = 18). RESULTS: Multifactorial etiology was present in 58% of <br>patients with combined BCS-<span style="color: red">PVT</span>. Number of etiological factors increased <br>significantly with the extent of thrombosis (p= 0.002). Main treatment <br>options included <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> and portosystemic shunting, of which <br>extended TIPS showed the most beneficial results. Five-year survival was 59% <br>(95% CI 39-80%) in BCS-<span style="color: red">PVT</span> versus 85% (95% CI 76-88%) in isolated BCS (p= <br>0.11). Survival tended to be worse in BCS-<span style="color: red">PVT</span> patients with SMVT as compared <br>to patients without SMVT (RR = 3.47, p= 0.11). CONCLUSIONS: In BCS, <br>extension of thrombosis into the splanchnic venous bed was significantly <br>related to the number of etiological factors, and was associated with poor <br>outcome. These results strongly support a liberal use of anticoagulants, <br>which so far had been widely debated.

Exegesis. - A 29 year old man has presented a <br>CMV hepatitis proved by the presence of pp65 protein and the viral DNA in <br>serum. This infection was complicated by a portal thrombosis and the <br>evolution was rapidly favourable under anticoagulant treatment. Eleven cases <br>of major thrombosis complicating acute CMV infection in immunocompetent <br>patients were previously reported in the English and French literature. The <br>absence of local and general cause, the remission without <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, <br>the elevated risk of thrombosis in both HIV and CMV seropositive patients, <br>and in CMV seropositive renal transplant patients suggest a causal relation. <br>Various pathogenic hypotheses were raised: presence of antiphospholipid <br>antibodies, absent in our case, procoagulant phenotype induction of infected <br>endothelial cells, proliferation induction of smooth cells. Conclusion. - <br>The acute CMV infection can be considered such as a possible cause of major <br>thrombosis. © 2005 Elsevier SAS.

Date of <br>Publication: 2005<br><br>Objective: To study the prevalence of thrombophilic conditions in patients <br>with acute and chronic <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) and to compare it with <br>those in patients suffering from deep vein thrombosis (DVT) after lower limb <br>arthroplasty and in healthy subjects. Methods : Twenty-six patients with <br>spontaneous <span style="color: red">PVT</span> (20 chronic, 6 acute) with normal liver function and not <br>receiving anticoagulants were evaluated for thrombophilic conditions. Levels <br>of protein C, protein S and antithrombin were compared with those in 50 <br>healthy controls. Factor V gene 'Leiden' mutation (FVL) and high <br>homocysteine levels were looked for in patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> and in 18 patients <br>developing post-arthroplasty lower limb DVT despite <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. <br>Results: Of 26 patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, 19 had at least one thrombotic condition <br>(acute <span style="color: red">PVT</span> 5/6, chronic <span style="color: red">PVT</span> 14/20) and 12 had more than one such condition; <br>in comparison, of 18 patients with DVT, eight had one thrombophilic <br>condition and one had two such conditions (p=0.03). Patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> had <br>significantly lower levels of protein C, protein S and antithrombin than <br>healthy subjects and those with DVT. Six patients had Factor VIII levels <br>above 150%; four had elevated homocysteine levels and three had detectable <br>anti-cardiolipin antibodies. Three patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> (acute 2, chronic 1) <br>were heterozygous for FVL mutation.

Recent data indicate that the mortality rate <br>is decreasing owing to earlier diagnosis and <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. The authors <br>examined the treatment profile of MVT to see how the increased use of <br>imaging and early <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> has impacted this process. They <br>retrospectively analyzed the treatment paradigm with acute MVT at one <br>institution over a 10-year period. Twenty-three patients were identified. <br>Data were analyzed using chi-squares and Student's t tests. Twenty-three <br>patients (11 men and 12 women with an average age of 51.74 ± 14.8 years) <br>were identified with acute MVT between the years of 1993 and 2003. Five <br>patients had splenic vein thrombosis, 17 had superior mesenteric vein <br>thrombosis, 1 had inferior mesenteric vein thrombosis, and 12 had portal <br>vein thrombosis. Nine patients had combination mesenteric vein segment <br>thrombosis. Thrombolytics were utilized in a total of 6 patients. Four of <br>the 6 patients in whom lytics were utilized had combined mesenteric vein <br>thrombosis; however, these 4 patients did not require surgical intervention. <br>There was no significant difference in length of hospital stay between <br>patients taking lytics versus patients treated with traditional <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> with heparin (p = 0.291). A hypercoagulable state was <br>identified in 66.7% of the patients. Four patients required surgical <br>intervention. The overall mortality rate was 8.7% (2 of 23). The use of <br>thrombolytics was associated with a significant mortality (p = 0.04). The <br>use of antibiotics made no difference in mortality (p = 0.235), nor did <br>antibiotic use influence length of hospitalization (p = 0.192). MVT is <br>relatively rare, and often the delay in diagnosis increases the mortality <br>rate.

Date of Publication: <br>September 2005<br><br>Purpose of review: Venous thromboembolism has become an increasingly <br>recognized clinical entity in children over the past decade. Recently, <br>important efforts have been made to track post thrombotic outcomes. The <br>present review discusses the knowledge gained from seminal studies in the <br>field over the past decade, with particular emphasis on the findings of <br>numerous published reports on outcomes of various types of venous <br>thromboembolism in the pediatric literature from January 2003 to January <br>2005. Recent findings: Large cohort studies involving acute venous <br>thromboembolism of all types in children have recently confirmed a rather <br>low frequency of recurrent venous thromboembolism, but have shown a lack of <br>thrombus resolution following standard-duration anticoagulant therapy in as <br>many as 50% of patients. In addition, the development of the post thrombotic <br>syndrome has been demonstrated in greater than one third of children with <br>venous thromboembolism involving the extremities. Persistent thrombosis <br>despite adequate <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> has been independently associated with <br>complete vaso-occlusion at diagnosis. Furthermore, the presence of elevated <br>levels of factor VIII and D-dimer either at diagnosis or following three to <br>six months <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> has now been defined as a predictor of adverse <br>long-term outcomes of pediatric thrombosis. Summary: This body of work <br>indicates that the various forms of venous thromboembolism in children are <br>in general associated with a considerable degree of adverse outcomes, <br>particularly in the form of venous thromboembolism-related mortality, <br>recurrent thromboembolism, and development of post thrombotic syndrome. <br>Advances in the prediction of post thrombotic outcomes have begun, and must <br>continue to facilitate a risk-stratified approach to antithrombotic <br>management in children, and to ultimately achieve meaningful improvements in <br>long-term outcomes. © 2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.<br><br>RECORD 757<br>High incidence of recurrence and hematologic events following liver <br>transplantation for Budd-Chiari syndrome<br>Cruz E.

Date of Publication: August <br>2005<br><br>Background: Most cases of Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) in Western countries <br>are related to underlying hematologic diseases with inherent thrombogenic <br>propensity. We evaluated the long-term outcome, risks for recurrent disease, <br>and other hematologic complications following orthotopic liver <br>transplantation (OLT) for BCS. Methods: Clinical data from 11 consecutive <br>patients with BCS who underwent OLT were retrospectively reviewed. Four <br>patients had a prior transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt and one <br>had a surgical shunt procedure. All patients were started on intravenous <br>heparin within the first 24 h following OLT.

Date of Publication: 2005<br><br>The transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is an <br>interventional treatment resulting in decompression of the portal system by <br>creation of a side-to-side portosystemic anastomosis. Since its introduction <br>16 years ago, more than 1,000 publications have appeared demonstrating broad <br>acceptance and increasing clinical use. This review summarizes our present <br>knowledge about technical aspects and complications, follow-up of patients <br>and indications. A technical success rate near 100% and a low occurrence of <br>complications clearly depend on the skills of the operator. The follow-up of <br>the TIPS patient has to assess shunt patency, liver function, hepatic <br>encephalopathy and the possible development of hepatocellular carcinoma. <br>Shunt patency can best be monitored by duplex sonography and can avoid <br>routine radiological revision. Short-term patency may be improved by <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>, while such a treatment does not influence long-term <br>patency. Stent grafts covered with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene show <br>promising long-term patency comparable with that of surgical shunts. With <br>respect to the indications of TIPS, much is known about treatment of <br>variceal bleeding and refractory ascites. The thirteen randomized studies <br>that are available to date show that survival is comparable in pa-tients <br>receiving TIPS or endoscopic treatment for acute or recurrent variceal <br>bleeding. Another group comprises patients with refractory ascites and <br>related complications, such as hepatorenal syndrome and hepatic hydrothorax. <br>It has been demonstrated that TIPS improves these complications. Five <br>randomized studies comparing TIPS with paracentesis and one study comparing <br>TIPS with the peritoneo-venous shunt showed good response of ascites but <br>controversial results on survival. In addition, TIPS has been successfully <br>applied to patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome, <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>, <br>before liver transplantation, and for the treatment of ectopic variceal <br>bleeding.

The objective <br>of this report is to describe our management of a recent laparoscopic case, <br>discuss current therapies, and consider antiplatelet therapy for <br>prophylaxis. METHODS: Medical records, laboratory studies, and imaging <br>studies pertaining to a recent case of a laparoscopic splenectomy were <br>examined. Current literature related to this topic was reviewed. RESULTS: A <br>16-year-old girl underwent laparoscopic splenectomy for idiopathic <br>thrombocytopenic purpura. Her preoperative platelet count was 96K. She was <br>discharged on postoperative day 1 after an uneventful operation including <br>division of the splenic hilum with an endoscopic linear stapler. On <br>postoperative day 20, she presented with a 5-day history of epigastric pain, <br>nausea, and low-grade fevers without peritoneal signs. Her white blood cell <br>count was 17.3; her platelets were 476K. Computed tomography demonstrated <br>thrombosis of the splenic, superior mesenteric, and portal veins propagating <br>into the liver. Heparinization was begun followed by an unsuccessful attempt <br>at pharmacologic and mechanical thrombolysis by interventional radiology. <br>Over the next 5 days, her pain resolved, she tolerated a full diet, was <br>converted to oral <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> and sent home.

Date of Publication: 25 Jun <br>2005<br><br>Background: Portal and mesenteric venous thrombosis (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) is an uncommon <br>disease with serious consequences if not discovered early in order to <br>prevent complications such as variceal bleeding and intestinal ischaemia. <br>The objective of this study was to describe the clinical presentation and <br>outcome of patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> with a view to early diagnosis and treatment of <br>this disease. The study was restricted to patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> not caused by <br>underlying <span style="color: red">liver cirrhosis</span>. Patients and methods: To analyse important <br>clinical characteristics of this entity we performed a retrospective study <br>of 20 non-cirrhotic patients seen in our hospital from February 1998 to <br>March 2003. Results: The main clinical symptom was abdominal pain (13 <br>patients, 86%), sometimes in combination with diarrhoea and vomiting (5 <br>patients, 33%), nausea and anorexia (3 patients). Laboratory signs were <br>non-specific and diagnosis was usually by computed tomography (19 patients, <br>95%). Causative factors included prothrombotic states (9 patients, 45%) <br>and/or local factors (5 patients, 25%). Complications must be expected from <br>portal hypertension (15 patients, 75%), which was associated with variceal <br>bleeding in 6 patients (30%). Bowel ischaemia (5 patients, 25%) and bowel <br>infarction (2 patients) were less frequent. Treatment consisted of immediate <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in almost all cases (18 patients, 90%), while invasive <br>approaches were followed in selected patients. The prognosis of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> was good <br>in patients without a severe underlying disease (median followup 21 months). <br>Conclusions: In agreement with other studies our results suggest that early <br>diagnosis and treatment by immediate <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> are important in <br>preventing the serious consequences of portal and mesenteric vein occlusion. <br>The role of more invasive approaches is less well defined. Since in 18 <br>patients (90%) of the non-cirrhotic cases in the present series causative <br>factors were found which may have therapeutic implications, aetiological <br>screening seems worthwhile in every case with <span style="color: red">PVT</span>.<br><br>RECORD 764<br>Portal-splenic-mesenteric venous thrombosis secondary to a mutation of the <br>prothrombin gene<br>Frutos Bernal M.D. Fernández Hernández J.A.

Results: The incidence of splanchnic vein <br>thrombosis at evaluation was 8.4%. Seventeen additional patients (7.4%) <br>developed de novo thrombosis after evaluation. Independent risk factors for <br>thrombosis were low platelet count (77.4 (36.3) v 111.6 (69.2) 10(9)/l; P = <br>0.001), a past history of variceal bleeding (47.4% v 29.1%; p = 0.003), and <br>a prolonged interval from listing to transplantation (8.5 (6.8) v 4.8 (4.4) <br>months; p = 0.002). The proportion of partial or complete recanalisation was <br>significantly higher in those who received (8/19) than in those who did not <br>receive (0/10, p = 0.002) <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. Survival was significantly lower <br>in those who had complete <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> at the time of surgery (p = <br>0.04). Conclusion: These results support a systematic screening for <br>splanchnic vein thrombosis in patients awaiting transplantation. They <br>suggest that in these patients, <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> is safe and has a <br>significant impact on recanalisation as well as prevention of extension of <br>thrombosis.<br><br>RECORD 766<br>Transcatheter thrombolytic therapy for acute mesenteric and portal vein <br>thrombosis<br>Hollingshead M. Burke C.T. Mauro M.A. Weeks S.M. Dixon R.G. Jaques P.F.<br>Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2005) 16:5 (651-661). Date <br>of Publication: May 2005<br><br>PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of <br>transcatheter thrombolytic therapy in 20 patients with acute or subacute <br>(symptoms <40 days) portal and/or mesenteric vein thrombosis with severe <br>symptoms, deteriorating clinical condition, and/or persistent symptoms <br>despite <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study <br>examined 12 male patients and eight female patients seen over a period of 11 <br>years. The average age was 37.6 years. Four of the patients had previously <br>undergone liver transplantation. An anatomic classification system was <br>established to describe the extent of thrombus at the time of diagnosis. <br>Patients were treated with thrombolytic therapy via the transhepatic route, <br>common femoral vein route, and/or superior mesenteric artery route. <br>Improvement in symptoms, avoidance of bowel resection, complications, and <br>radiographic evidence of clot resolution were the main clinical outcomes. <br>RESULTS: Fifteen of the 20 patients exhibited some degree of lysis of the <br>thrombus. Three patients had complete resolution, 12 had partial resolution, <br>and five had no resolution. Eighty-five percent of patients (n = 17) had <br>resolution of symptoms. Sixty percent of patients (n = 12) developed a major <br>complication. No patients required bowel resection after thrombolytic <br>therapy. One patient died with gastrointestinal hemorrhage and septic shock <br>2 weeks after thrombolytic therapy. Other major complications included <br>bleeding and conditions requiring transfusion. No patients developed new <br>portal or mesenteric thromboses. Two of the patients who received <br>transplants eventually required repeat transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: <br>Transcatheter thrombolysis was beneficial in avoiding patient death, <br>resolving thrombus, improving symptoms, and avoiding bowel resection. <br>However, there was a high complication rate, indicating that this therapy <br>should be reserved for patients with severe disease. Further evaluation of <br>these techniques and outcomes should continue to be pursued. © SIR, 2005.<br><br>RECORD 767<br><span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span>: Etiology, diagnostic strategy, therapy and <br>management<br>Hidajat N.

With imaging <br>methods, <span style="color: red">PVT</span> with or without cavernous transformation can be diagnosed. <br>Fresh thrombus can be undetected in sonography due to the low echogenity but <br>can be recognized in color Doppler sonography, especially with <br>contrast-enhancing agent.

Therapeutical options of <span style="color: red">PVT</span> consist of mechanical <br>recanalization of the portal vein, local fibrinolysis with or without <br>placement of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (TIPS), <br>combination of mechanical recanalization and local fibrinolysis, systemic <br>thrombolytic therapy, <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> alone and surgical thrombectomy. Once <br><span style="color: red">PVT</span> is found in sonography, Doppler sonography may be performed in order to <br>distinguish benign from malignant thrombus. If further information is <br>needed, MR angiography or contrast enhanced CT is the next step. If these <br>tests are unsatisfactory, digital subtraction angiography should be <br>performed. Until the early nineties, shunt surgery was recommended in <br>patients with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> who bled despite endoscopic treatment. Today, in <br>symptomatic noncavernomatous <span style="color: red">PVT</span>, recanalization with local methods is <br>recommended.

Burroughs A.K.<br>Nature Clinical Practice Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2005) 2:4 <br>(182-190). Date of Publication: April 2005<br><br>Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) occurs as a result of obstruction of hepatic <br>venous outflows at any level from the small hepatic veins to the junction of <br>the inferior vena cava with the right atrium. Diagnosis can be difficult <br>because of the wide spectrum of presentation of the disease and the varying <br>severity of liver damage. The traditional classification of BCS - as <br>fulminant, acute or chronic - is not prognostically useful. This makes <br>assessing the benefit of therapy difficult, especially as there is no <br>evidence from randomized studies. This article highlights advances in the <br>prognosis and therapy of BCS. Identification of the site of venous <br>obstruction has a major effect on prognosis. Portal-vein thrombosis occurs <br>in 20-30% of cases, and acute presentation of BCS reflects an acute or <br>chronic syndrome in 60% of BCS cases. BCS can be diagnosed and treated on a <br>single occasion in the setting of the radiology department, with hepatic <br>venography, transjugular liver biopsy, retrograde CO2 portography and <br>inferior vena cava pressure measurements performed simultaneously with <br>therapies such as dilation or stenting of webs in the inferior vena cava or <br>hepatic veins, and placement of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic <br>shunts. Disruption of a portal vein thrombus can also be done during the <br>same session. Surgical shunts have been superseded by the use of <br>transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts. Liver transplantation is <br>reserved for ftihninant and progressive chronic forms of BCS. <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy must be used routinely, before and after specific <br>therapy, regardless of whether a thrombophilic disorder is diagnosed.<br><br>RECORD 771<br>Portal hypertension due to cavernomatosis of the portal vein [4]<br>Varona Arche J.F.

Mesenteric and <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> is rare <br>and can be presented as more serious conditions than that of SMVT. We report <br>patients with combined SMVT and <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (<span style="color: red">PVT</span>) who were <br>treated successfully with early initiation of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span>. Methods: The <br>medical records of six patients (five male, one female) who presented with <br>combined SMVT and <span style="color: red">PVT</span> in our institute between January 1994 and September <br>2003 were reviewed retrospectively. All of the patients were treated with <br>early initiation of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> using unfractionated heparin or low <br>molecular weight heparin. Results: The mean hospital stay was 31 days and <br>the mean follow-up period was 32 months. Three patients had an antithrombin <br>III deficiency. The most common symptom was diffuse abdominal pain and signs <br>included abdominal distension and tenderness. During the follow-up period, <br>there were two patients who developed stricture of the small bowel <br>necessitating resection and anastomosis of the small bowel. There was no <br>case of peritonitis due to bowel necrosis or mortality. Conclusion: The <br>early initiation of <span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> in patients of SMVT combined with <span style="color: red">PVT</span> <br>could minimise the serious complication such as peritonitis due to bowel <br>necrosis required immediate exploratory laparotomy. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Beaugrand M.<br>European Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2005) 17:2 (179-184). <br>Date of Publication: February 2005<br><br>Background: Although partial splenic embolization (PSE) has been proposed in <br>patients with cirrhosis in cases when thrombocytopenia or neutropenia may <br>cause clinical manifestations or if there are contra-indications to other <br>therapeutic procedures, there are limited data on long-term outcome. We <br>provide a retrospective review of results and the tolerance of all PSE <br>procedures in patients with cirrhosis in our department. Patients and <br>methods: Thirty-two consecutive patients with cirrhosis were included over a <br>6 year period. Indications for PSE were as follows: (1) severe cytopenia <br>preventing necessary antiviral treatment (n=14), percutaneous destruction of <br>hepatocellular carcinoma (n=8) or major surgery (n=3), severe purpura (n=3); <br>(2) painful splenomegaly (n=4). After superselective catheterization, <br>embolization was performed with up to 50% reduction of splenic blood flow. <br>Results: Thrombocyte and leucocyte counts increased markedly (185% and 51% <br>at 1 month; 95% and 30% at 6 months). Thirty-one and 20 patients had <br>platelet count >80 000/mm(3) at months 1 and 6 vs only one before PSE. <br>Overall, the aim of PSE was achieved in 27 patients (84%) (planned <br>treatment: 20/25; disappearance of purpura and splenic pain: 7/7). Severe <br>complications occurred in five patients (16%): transient ascites (n=2), <br>splenic and/or <span style="color: red">portal vein thrombosis</span> (n=2) that resolved after <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy, and splenic abscess (n=2) leading to death. These <br>two patients had splenic necrosis >70%. Conclusion: In patients with <br>cirrhosis, PSE may resolve cytopenia and the clinical complications related <br>to hypersplenism or splenomegaly. However, due to a high risk of severe <br>complications, particularly splenic abscess, the indications of PSE should <br>be very limited and the extent of necrosis should be strictly controlled <br>during the PSE procedure. © 2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.<br><br>RECORD 774<br>Unrecognized pylephlebitis causing life-threatening septic shock: A case <br>report<br>Wireko M.

Habib F.A. Young S.C. Penney D. Oppat W. Mittal V.K.<br>JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons / Society of <br>Laparoendoscopic Surgeons (2005) 9:1 (87-90). Date of Publication: 2005 <br>Jan-Mar<br><br>BACKGROUND: Complications following laparoscopic cholecystectomy are <br>encountered infrequently due to increasing proficiency in laparoscopic <br>surgery. The occurrence of portal venous thrombosis following laparoscopic <br>cholecystectomy has not been previously described and forms the basis of <br>this report. METHODS: A healthy, 32-year-old, female on oral contraceptives <br>underwent an uneventful laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic <br>gallbladder disease. Sequential compression devices and mini-dose <br>unfractionated heparin were used before the procedure. The patient was <br>discharged home on the first postoperative day without complaints. She <br>returned 1 week later with nausea, bloating, and diffuse abdominal pain. <br>RESULTS: Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed thrombosis of the portal <br>vein not seen in the preoperative ultrasound and the superior mesenteric <br>vein. Computer tomography of the abdomen and pelvis on the same day <br>confirmed this finding and showed a wedge-shaped infarction of the right <br>lobe of the liver. The patient was anticoagulated with intravenous heparin. <br>An extensive coagulation workup revealed elevation of the Immunoglobulin G <br>anticardiolipin antibody. A percutaneous transhepatic portal vein <br>thrombectomy was performed. A postprocedure duplex ultrasound of the abdomen <br>demonstrated recannalization of the portal venous system with no flow voids. <br><span style="color: red">anticoagulation</span> therapy was continued, and the patient was discharged home <br>with resolution of her ileus. She was maintained on a therapeutic dose of <br>warfarin. CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrates an unusual complication of <br>laparoscopic cholecystectomy. It may have resulted from the use of oral <br>contraceptives, elevation of the Immunoglobulin G anticardiolipin antibody, <br>unrecognized trauma, and was accentuated by the pneumoperitoneum generated <br>for the performance of the laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Our case report <br>provides insight and poses questions regarding necessary perioperative <br>measures for thromboprophylaxis in young females on oral contraceptives <br>undergoing elective laparoscopic abdominal surgery.<br>
